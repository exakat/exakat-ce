Requirements
------------

Exakat relies on external components : mandatroy or optional.

Basic requirements : 

* exakat.phar, the main code.
* `Gremlin server <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/>`_ : exakat uses this graph database and the Gremlin 3 traversal language. Currently, only Gremlin Server is supported, with the tinkergraph and neo4j storage engine. Version 3.4.x is the recommended version, while version 3.3.x are still supported. Gremlin version 3.2.# and 3.5.# are unsupported. 
* Java 8.x. Java 9.x/10.x will be supported later. Java 7.x was used, but is not actively supported.
* `PHP <https://www.php.net/>`_ 8.0 to run. PHP 8.0 is recommended, PHP 7.2 or later are possible. This version requires the PHP extensions curl, hash, phar, sqlite3, tokenizer, mbstring and json. 

Optional requirements : 

* PHP 5.2 to 8.1-dev for analysis purposes. Those versions only require the ext/tokenizer extension. 
* VCS (Version Control Software), such as Git, SVN, bazaar, Mercurial. They all are optional, though git is recommended. 
* Archives, such as zip, tgz, tbz2 may also be opened with optional helpers (See `Installation guide for optional tools`_).

OS requirements : 

* Exakat has beed tested on OSX, Debian and Ubuntu (up to 20.04). 
* Exakat should work on Linux distributions, may be with little work. 
* Exakat hasn't been tested on Windows at all. 

For installation, curl or wget, and zip are needed.

Download exakat.phar
--------------------

You can download exakat directly from `https://www.exakat.io/ <https://www.exakat.io/>`_. 

This server also provides older versions of Exakat. It is recommended to always download the last version, which is available with `https://www.exakat.io/versions/index.php?file=latest <https://www.exakat.io/versions/index.php?file=latest>`_. 

For each version, MD5 and SHA256 signatures are available. The downloaded MD5 must match the one in the related .md5 file. The .md5 also has the version number, for extra check.

::

    curl -o exakat.phar 'https://www.exakat.io/versions/index.php?file=latest'
    
    curl -o exakat.phar.md5 'https://www.exakat.io/versions/index.php?file=latest.md5'

Installation with exakat.phar
-----------------------------

Exakat.phar includes its own installation script, as long as PHP is available. Exakat will then check different pre-requisites, and proceed to install some of the last elements.

Exakat checks for Java and Zip installations. Then, it downloads tinkergraph and the Neo4j plugin from exakat.io and runs the `doctor` command.

The script is based on the one displayed on the next section.

You can use the `install` command this way : 

::

    mkdir exakat
    cd exakat
    curl -o exakat.phar 'https://www.exakat.io/versions/index.php?file=latest'
    php exakat.phar install 


Installation on OSX
-------------------

Paste the following commands in a terminal prompt. It downloads Exakat, and installs tinkerpop version 3.4.11. 
PHP 7.4 or more recent, curl, homebrew are required.

OSX installation with tinkergraph 3.4.11
########################################

This is the installation script for Exakat and tinkergraph 3.4.11. 

::

    mkdir exakat
    cd exakat
    curl -o exakat.phar 'https://www.exakat.io/versions/index.php?file=latest'
    curl -o apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip 'https://www.exakat.io/versions/apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip'
    unzip apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip 
    mv apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11 tinkergraph
    rm -rf apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip 
    
    # Optional : install neo4j engine.
    cd tinkergraph
    ./bin/gremlin-server.sh install org.apache.tinkerpop neo4j-gremlin 3.4.11
    cd ..
    
    php exakat.phar doctor

OSX installation troubleshooting
################################

It has be reported that installation fails on OSX 10.11 and 10.12, with error similar to 'Error grabbing Grapes'. To fix this, use the following in command line : 

::

    rm -r ~/.groovy/grapes/
    rm -r ~/.m2/


They remove some files for grapes, that it will rebuild later. Then, try again the optional install instructions.



Installation on Debian/Ubuntu
-----------------------------

Debian/Ubuntu installation with Tinkergraph 3.4.11
##################################################

Paste the following commands in a terminal prompt. It installs Exakat most recent version with Tinkergraph 3.4.11. 
PHP 7.3 (7.0 or more recent), wget and unzip are expected.

::

    mkdir exakat
    cd exakat
    wget -O exakat.phar https://www.exakat.io/versions/index.php?file=latest
    wget -O apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip 'https://www.exakat.io/versions/apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip'
    unzip apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip 
    mv apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11 tinkergraph
    rm -rf apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.11-bin.zip 
    
    # Optional : install neo4j engine.
    cd tinkergraph
    ./bin/gremlin-server.sh install org.apache.tinkerpop neo4j-gremlin 3.4.11
    cd ..

    php exakat.phar doctor
    
    

Prerequisites : Full installation with Debian/Ubuntu

Installation guide with Composer
--------------------------------

Composer installation first run
###############################

To install Exakat with composer, you can use the following commands: 

::

    mkdir exakat
    cd exakat
    composer require exakat/exakat
    php vendor/bin/exakat install -v

The final command checks for the presence of Java and unZip utility. Then, it installs a local copy of a `Gremlin server <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/>`_. This is needed to run Exakat. 

To run your first audit, use the following commands: 

::

    php vendor/bin/exakat init -p sculpin -R 'https://github.com/sculpin/sculpin.git'
    php vendor/bin/exakat project -p sculpin
    


The final audit is now in the `projects/sculpin/report` directory.



Installation guide with Docker
------------------------------

There are multiple ways to use exakat with docker. There is an image with a full exakat installation, which run with a traditional installation, or inside the audited code. Or, You may use Docker with a standard installation, to run useful part, such as a specific PHP version or the central database. 

image:: images/exakat-and-docker.png

Docker image for Exakat with projects folder
############################################

Installation with Docker is easy, and convenient. It hides the dependency of the graph database, and keeps all files in the 'projects' folder, created in the working directory. 

Currently, Docker installation only ships with one PHP version (7.3), and with support for bazaar, composer, git, mercurial, svn, and zip.

* Install `Docker <http://www.docker.com/>`_
* Start Docker
* Pull exakat. The official docker page is `exakat/exakat <https://hub.docker.com/r/exakat/exakat/>`_.

::

    docker pull exakat/exakat

# Check-run exakat : 

::

    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat version
    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat doctor

# Init a project : 

::

    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat init -p <project name> -R <vcs_url>

If you need SSH credentials to clone a project, you may import your SSH keys in the repository by assigning them to the `exakat` user. With the commmand below, the local set of keys of user 'my-user' are assigned to `exakat` in the container. Note that those keys will request the passphrase, which will prevent their usage. 

::

    docker run -it -v /home/my-user/.ssh:/home/exakat/ssh -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat init -p <project name> -R <vcs_url>


# Run exakat : 

::

    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat project -p <project name>

# Run exakat directly in the code base. For that, the code needs to have the .exakat.yml or .exakat.ini file available at the root. Then, you may call exakat with the 'project' command, without other options. 

::

    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat project


For large code bases, it may be necessary to increase the allocated memory for the graph database. Do this by using the JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable when you start the docker command : this example gives 2Gb of RAM to the graphdb. That should cover medium size applications.

::

    docker run -it -e JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xms32m -Xmx2g" -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat


You may run any exakat command by prefixing it with the following command : 

::

    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat


You may also create a handy shortcut, by creating an exakat.sh script and put it in your PATH : 

::

    cat 'docker run -it -v $(pwd)/projects:/usr/src/exakat/projects --rm --name my-exakat exakat/exakat exakat $1' > /etc/local/sbin/exakat.sh
    chmod u+x  /etc/local/sbin/exakat.sh
    ./exakat.sh version

Docker image for Exakat with projects folder
############################################

To run exakat inside the audited code, you must configure the `.exakat.ini` or `.exakat.yaml` file. See `Add Exakat To Your CI Pipeline <https://www.exakat.io/add-exakat-to-your-ci-pipeline/>`_.

Then, you can run the following command, with docker : 

::

  docker run -it --rm -v `$pwd`:/src exakat/exakat:latest exakat project -v 


Docker PHP image with Exakat
############################

Exakat recognizes docker images configured as PHP binaries. Instead of configuring exakat with local binaries, such as `/usr/bin/php`, you may configure a specific PHP version with a docker image. 

Open the `config/exakat.ini` file, at the root of the exakat installation, and use the following value : 

::

    // configuration with the 'tetraweb/php:5.5' image. 
    ;php55 = tetraweb/php:5.5
    php56 = tetraweb/php:5.6
    # classic configuration with local binary
    php73 = /usr/bin/php


The image may be any docker image that provides a PHP binary. We suggest using `tetraweb/php <https://hub.docker.com/r/tetraweb/php/>`_, which supports PHP 5.5 to 7.1. There are other images available, and you may also roll out your own.

Docker Gremlin image with Exakat
################################

Exakat is able to use only the central database, Gremlin, as a docker image. This is convenient, as the database is only a temporary database, and those data are not necessary for producing the final reports. 

This image is under construction, and will be soon available. 


Installation guide as Github Action
-----------------------------------

Github Action
#############

`Github Action <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_ is a way to "Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository". Exakat may be run on Github platform.
 
 
Github Action for Exakat
########################

To add Exakat to your repository on Github, create a file `.github/workflows/test.yml`, at the root of your repository (`.github/workflows` might already exists).

In the file, use the following YAML code. It will create an automatic action, on push and pull_request actions, that runs Exakat and display the issues found in the workflow panel. It is also possible to run manually this action. 

:: 

    on: [push, pull_request]
    name: Test
    jobs:
      exakat:
        name: Exakat
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Exakat
          uses: docker://exakat/exakat-ga

Note : it is recommended to edit this file directly on github.com, as it cannot be pushed from a remote repository. 

Then, you can use the `Action` button, next to 'Pull requests'. This will run Exakat on the repository, with the 'CI-checks' ruleset, and in the 'Perfile' format. 

Github Action Configuration directives
######################################

It is possible to provide custom directives to the Exakat Github action, by using the 'with' keyword in the configuration. Here is an example : 

:: 

    on: [push, pull_request]
    name: Test
    jobs:
      exakat:
        name: Exakat
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Exakat
          uses: docker://exakat/exakat-ga
        - with:
          ignore_rules: 'Classes/StaticMethodsCalledFromObject,Php/ShouldUseCoalesce,Functions/UsesDefaultArguments'
          ignore_dirs: '/path/to/repos#1,/path/to/repos#2,/path/to/repos#3'

The supported directives are the following: 


* **exit_on_issues** : default to true. The github action returns with exit code 1 if any issue is found during the review. Set this to empty string, to have the action return 0. You may also configure the step with `continue-on-error <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepscontinue-on-error>`_.
* **ignore_rules** : default to empty. A comma-separated list of Exakat rule short names, that will be excluded from the review. For example : ignore_rules: Structures/AddOne,Structures/PlusEgalOne. 
* **ignore_dirs** : default to empty. A comma-separated list folders that will be omitted. They are relative to the root of the repository.
* **include_dirs** : default to empty. A comma-separated list folders that must be added. They are relative to the root of the repository, and will be added after the ignore_dirs directive.
* **file_extensions** : default to exakat's default value. A comma-separated list of file extensions to filter the processed files. Default list is php,php3,inc,tpl,phtml,tmpl,phps,ctp,module. This configuration replaces the default one. 
* **project_reports** : default to Perfile. A comma-separated list of Exakat reports to be processed. For example : Perfile,Sarif,Diplomat. Reports such as 'Diplomat' must be uploaded elsewhere (with `upload artifact <https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact>`_), as the produced file will be written in the Github Action, which is later removed.

Upload reports as artefact
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When producing a report with Github action, the result is either send to STDOUT, aka the log in the Github interface. Or, it is written in the Github action. When this is done, the report must be uploaded out of the Github action to be preserved. 

Github upload, aka actions/upload-artifact@v2, may be used for that purpose. Add the following configuration in the action file : 

::

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: my-exakat-report
        path: /github/workspace/path/to/report


The path to report is stored in the ``/github/workspace`` folder, with different names depending on the requested exakat report. For example, the `Yaml` report is exported to 'exakat.yaml', while the `Diplomat` report is stored in a folder called 'diplomat'. Thus, the configuration shall be : 

::

    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: my-exakat-report
        path: /github/workspace/diplomat


Exakat Docker image for Github Action
#####################################

A Docker image is released with Exakat's version automatically, to be used with Github Action. It is available at `https://hub.docker.com/r/exakat/exakat-ga <https://hub.docker.com/r/exakat/exakat-ga>`_.

You can run it in any given directory like this:


:: 

    cd /path/to/code
    docker pull exakat/exakat-ga
    docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/app exakat/exakat-ga:latest

Using multiple PHP versions
---------------------------

You need at least one version of PHP to run exakat. This version needs the `curl <http://www.php.net/curl>`_, `hash <http://www.php.net/hash>`_, `tokenizer <http://www.php.net/tokenizer>`_, `hash <http://www.php.net/hash>`_ and `sqlite3 <http://www.php.net/sqlite3>`_ extensions. They all are part of the core. 

Extra PHP-CLI versions allow more linting of the code. They only need to have the `tokenizer <http://www.php.net/tokenizer>`_ extension available.  

Exakat recommends PHP 8.0.x (or newer version) to run Exakat. We also recommend the installation of PHP versions 5.6, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1 (aka php-src master).

To install easily various versions of PHP, use the ondrej repository. Check `The main PPA for PHP (8.0, 7.4, 7.3, 7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 5.6)  <https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php>`_.
You may also check the dotdeb repository, at `dotdeb instruction <https://www.dotdeb.org/instructions/>`_ or compile PHP yourself. 


Installation guide for optional tools
-------------------------------------

Exakat is able to use a variety of tools to access PHP code to audit. Some external tools are necessary. You can check which tools are recognized locally with the `exakat doctor -v` command. 

* `bazaar <https://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`_ : the `bzr` command must be available.
* `composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ : the `composer` command must be available.
* `CVS <https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>`_ : the `cvs` command must be available
* `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ : the `git` command must be available.
* `mercurial <https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>`_ : the `hg` must be available
* `Svn <https://subversion.apache.org/>`_ : the `svn` command must be available.
* tgz : the `tar` and `gunzip` commands must be available
* tbz : the `tar` and `bunzip2` commands must be available.
* `rar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR_(file_format)>`_ : the `rar` commands must be available.
* `zip <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)>`_ : the `unzip` command must be available.
* `7z <https://www.7-zip.org/7z.html>`_ : the `7z` command must be available

The binaries above are used with the `init` and `update` commands, to get the source code. They are optional.
