name = "Set class_alias() Definition";
description = "Links ``new`` calls to the concrete class when class_alias() was used to create the name. The link is ``DEFINITION``.

class_alias() are detected at loading time, and are used unconditionally.

This means that the fully qualified name of the ``new`` call and the instantiated class may be different : without the alias, the fully qualified name is the current value, or its use's origin, while with class_alias(), it is an arbitrary name.
