name = "Set Class_Alias Definition";
description = "Links ``new`` calls to the concrete class when class_alias() was used to create the name. The link is ``DEFINITION``.

class_alias() are detected at loading time, and are used unconditionally.

This means that the fully qualified name of the ``new`` call and the instantiated class may be different : without the alias, the fully qualified name is the current fullcode, or its use's origin, while with class_alias(), it is an arbitrary name.

<?php

class x {
    public function foo() {}
}

class_alias('x', 'y');

//y exists, as an alias of x.
$y = new y;
