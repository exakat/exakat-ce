name = "Create Magic Property";
description = "This command creates a link DEFINITION between a ``__get`` and ``__set`` calls, and its equivalent magic method.

It also adds links between ``__invoke`` and ``__toString`` in adapted situations.

<?php

class x {
    function foo() {
        // This is linked to __set
        $this->a = 1;
        
        // This is linked to __get
        return $this->b;
    }
    
    function __get($name) {
        return 1;
    }

    function __set($name, $value) {
        // Store the value
    }
}

?>

This command may not detect all possible link for the ``__get`` and ``__set`` call. It may be missing information about the nature of the object.
