description = "This command creates a link DEFINITION between a ``__call()`` and ``__callStatic()`` calls, and its equivalent magic method.

<?php

class x {
    function foo() {
        // This is linked to __call
        $this->c();
        
        // This is linked to __callStatic
        return $this::C();
    }
    
    function __call($name, $args) {
        // Normal method call
    }

    function __callStatic($name, $args) {
        // Static method call
    }
}

?>

This command may not detect all possible link for the ``__get()`` and ``__set()`` call. It may be missing information about the nature of the object. ``Self``, ``static``, ``parent`` and simple variables are detected.
