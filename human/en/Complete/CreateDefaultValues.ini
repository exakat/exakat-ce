Variables have no definition expression in PHP. Exakat holds their definition with the `Variabledefinition` node.

Properties have definitions, and non-compulsory default values. This command creates multiple DEFINITION link for them.

DEFAULT is convenient in the case of `null` value, which will be assigned an object at execution time. 
Short assignations, such as `+=`  are not considered default value. It needs to be a full assignation";
