name = "Create Default Values";
description = "This commands adds a link between variables, property definitions and any assignation to this container.

Variables have no definition expression in PHP. Exakat holds their definition with the `Variabledefinition` node.

Properties have definitions, and non-compulsory default values. This command creates multiple DEFINITION link for them.

DEFAULT is convenient in the case of `null` value, which will be assigned an object at execution time. 

<?php

function foo() {
    // local Variabledefinition links to this expression
    $a = 1;
}

class x {
    // 1 is a default value
    private $p = 1;
    
    function __construct() {
        // 2 is also a default value for this.
        // This default value is different from the above as it is a part of an assignation
        $this->p = 2;
    }
}

?>

Short assignations, such as `+=`  are not considered default value. It needs to be a full assignation
