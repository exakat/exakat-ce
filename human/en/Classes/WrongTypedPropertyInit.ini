name = "Wrong Typed Property Default";
description = "Property is typed, yet receives an incompatible value at constructor time.

Initialized type might be a new instance, the return of a method call or an interface compatible object.

<?php

class x {
    private A $property;
    private B $incompatible;
    
    function __construct() {
        // This is compatible
        $this->property = new A();
        
        // This is incompatible : new B() expected
        $this->incompatible = new C();
        
    }
}

?>

PHP compiles such code, but won't execute it, as it detects the incompatibility at execution time.
