name = "Use ::Class Operator";
description = "Use ``::class`` to hardcode class names, instead of strings.

This is actually faster than strings, which are parsed at execution time, while ``::class`` is compiled, making it faster to execute. 

``::class`` operator is also able to handle use expressions, including aliases and local namespace. The code is easier to maintain. For example, the target class's namespace may be renamed, without changing the ``::class``, while the string must be updated.

``::class`` operator works with ``self`` and ``static``keywords. 

<?php

namespace foo\bar;

use foo\bar\X as B;

class X {}

$className = '\foo\bar\X';

$className = foo\bar\X::class;

$className = B\X;

$object = new $className;

?>

This is not possible when building the name of the class with concatenation.

This is a micro-optimization. This also helps static analysis, as it gives more information at compile time to analyse.
