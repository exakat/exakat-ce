name = "Redefined Property";
description = "Property redefined in a parent class. 

Using heritage, it is possible to define several times the same property, at different levels of the hierarchy.

<?php

class foo {
    protected $aProperty = 1;
}

class bar extends foo {
    // This property is redefined in the parent class, leading to potential confusion
    protected $aProperty = 1;
}

?>

When this is the case, it is difficult to understand which class will actually handle the property. 

In the case of a private property, the different instances will stay distinct. In the case of protected or public properties, they will all share the same value. 

It is recommended to avoid redefining the same property in a hierarchy. ";
