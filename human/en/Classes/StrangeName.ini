Ever wondered why the ``__constructor`` is never called? Or the ``__consturct`` ? 

Those errors most often originate from typos, or quick fixes that where not fully tested. Other times, they were badly chosen, or ran into PHP's own reserved keywords. 

<?php

class foo {
    // The real constructor
    function __construct() {}

    // The fake constructor
    function __constructor() {}
    
    // The 'typo'ed' constructor
    function __consturct() {}
    
    // This doesn't clone
    function clone() {}
}

?>
