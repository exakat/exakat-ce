name = "Undefined ::class";
description = "``::class`` doesn't check if a corresponding class exists. 

``::class`` must be checked with a call to class_exists(). Otherwise, it may lead to a ``Class 'foo' not found`` or even silent dead code : this happens also with Catch and instanceof commands with undefined classes. PHP doesn't raise an error in that case. 

<?php

class foo() {}

// prints foo
echo foo::class; 

// prints bar though bar doesn't exist.
echo bar::class;

?>
