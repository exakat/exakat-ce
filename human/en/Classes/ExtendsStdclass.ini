Traditionally, classes are defined independently, without any native class extension. 

In PHP 8.2, dynamic properties are deprecated, and yield a warning in the logs. Adding 'extends \\stdClass' to classes signature removes this warning, as stdclass is the empty class, without any method, property nor constants.";
