While this is syntactically correct, it is unusual that defined resources are used in a child class. It may be worth moving the definition to another class, or to move accessing methods to the class.

class foofoo extends foo {
    function bar() {
        $this->unused++; // property $unused is used in this method, but defined in the parent class
