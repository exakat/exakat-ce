PHP defers the implements check until execution : the code in example does lint, but won,t run.

<?php

class x {
    function foo() {}
}

interface y {
    function foo();
}

// Use implements with an interface
class z implements y {}

// Implements is for an interface, not a class
class z implements x {}
