description = "Those methods are never called. 

They are probably dead code, unless they are called dynamically.

This analysis omits methods which are in a class that makes dynamical self calls : ``$this->$m()``. That way, any method may be called. 

This analysis omits methods which are overwritten by a child class. That way, they are considered to provide a default behavior. 

<?php

class foo {
    public function used() {
        $this->used();
    }

    public function unused() {
        $this->used();
    }
}

class bar extends foo {
    public function some() {
        $this->used();
    }
}

$a = new foo();
$a->used();

?>
