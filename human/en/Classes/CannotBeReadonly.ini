description = "This analysis reports different situations where a property is readonly, and has some impossible code. 

Two cases are reported : 
+ a self-updated property, where it is updated with a value that is created from itself. The most obvious is ``$this->a = $this->a;`` (which is reported as an error by PHP), and ``$this->a = foo($this->a);`` is the most common.
+ a property which is set in the constructor, yet has a distinct method where it is updated too. 

Most of thoses cases are dead code.";
