name = "Ambiguous Static";
description = "Methods or properties with the same name, are defined static in one class, and not static in another. This is error prone, as it requires a good knowledge of the code to make it static or not. 

Try to keep the methods simple and unique. Consider renaming the methods and properties to distinguish them easily. A method and a static method have probably different responsibilities.

<?php

class a {
    function mixedStaticMethod() {}
}

class b {
    static function mixedStaticMethod() {}
}

/... a lot more code later .../

$c->mixedStaticMethod();
// or 
$c::mixedStaticMethod();

?>
