This analysis counts both static calls and normal call; methods, properties and constants. It also takes into account arrays along the way.

The default limit of chaining methods and properties is set to 7 by default.

// 9 chained calls.
$main->getA()->getB()->getC()->getD()->getE()->getF()->getG()->getH()->getI()->property;

?>

Too many chained methods is harder to read.
