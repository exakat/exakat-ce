name = "Property Used In One Method Only";
description = "Properties should be used in several methods. When a property is used in only one method, this should have be of another shape. 

Properties used in one method only may be used several times, and read only. This may be a class constant. Such properties are meant to be overwritten by an extending class, and that's possible with class constants.

Properties that read and written may be converted into a variable, static to the method. This way, they are kept close to the method, and do not pollute the object's properties.

<?php

class foo {
    private $once = 1;
    const ONCE = 1;
    private $counter = 0;
    
    function bar() {
        // $this->once is never used anywhere else. 
        someFunction($this->once);
        someFunction(self::ONCE);   // Make clear that it is a 
    }

    function bar2() {
        static $localCounter = 0;
        $this->counter++;
        
        // $this->once is only used here, for distinguising calls to someFunction2
        if ($this->counter > 10) { // $this->counter is used only in bar2, but it may be used several times
            return false;
        }
        someFunction2($this->counter);

        // $localCounter keeps track for all the calls
        if ($localCounter > 10) { 
            return false;
        }
        someFunction2($localCounter);
    }
}

Note : properties used only once are not returned by this analysis. They are omitted, and are available in the analysis `Used Once Property`_.
