name = "Undefined Properties";
description = "List of properties that are not explicitly defined in the class, its parents or traits.

<?php

class foo {
    // property definition
    private bar = 2;
    
    function foofoo() {
        // $this->bar is defined in the class
        // $this->barbar is NOT defined in the class
        return $this->bar + $this->barbar;
    }
}

?>

It is possible to spot unidentified properties by using the PHP's magic methods ``__get`` and ``__set``. Even if the class doesn't use magic methods, any call to an undefined property will be directed to those methods, and they can be used as a canary, warning that the code is missing a definition. 

<?php

trait NoUnefinedProperties {
	function __get($name) {
		assert(false, \"Attempt to read the $name property, on the class \".__CLASS__;
	}

	function __set($name, $value) {
		assert(false, \"Attempt to read the $name property, on the class \".__CLASS__;
	}
}

?>

In PHP 8.2, undefined properties are reported as deprecated. They will be a Fatal Error in PHP 9.0.
