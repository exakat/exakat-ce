name = "Could Be Stringable";
description = "``Stringable`` is an interface that marks classes with a custom method to cast the object as a string. It was introduced in PHP 8.0.

Classes that defined a __toString() magic method may be turned into a string when the typehint, argument, return or property, requires it. This is not the case when strict_types is activated. Yet, until PHP 8.0, there was nothing to identify a class as such.

<?php 

// This class may implement Stringable
class x {
    function __tostring() {
        return 'asd';
    }
}

echo (new x);

?>
