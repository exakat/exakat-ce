name = "Useless NullSafe Operator";
description = "Nullsafe operator ``?->`` has no object when the types are never null, or when coalesce is active.

The nullsafe operator protects the execution from accessing a method or a property on a null value. If the object part of the syntax cannot be null, then the nullsafe operator ``?->`` will not protect it. 

The nullsafe operator is filling the same duty as ``??`` operator, although with a more granular precision.
