name = "DI Cyclic Dependencies";
description = "When injecting dependencies, classes that mutually depend on each other is a code smell. 

Dependency injection should be organized as an acyclic tree-like structure

<?php

// Classes A and B depends on each other. 
class A {
    protected $b;

    public function __construct(B $b) {
        $this->b = $b;
    }
}

class B {
    public $a;

    protected function setA(A $a) {
        $this->a = $a;
    }
}
?>
