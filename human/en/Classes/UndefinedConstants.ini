description = "Class constants that are used, but never defined. This should yield a fatal error upon execution, but no feedback at compile level.

This analysis takes into account native PHP class constants, extensions and stubs. It also disambiguate enumeration cases. 

<?php

class foo {
    const A = 1;
}

// here, C is not defined in the code and is reported
echo foo::A.foo::B.foo::C;

?>

Constants are searched in the typed class or interface and its parent. They are not searched in the children, since the children are not necesseraly available. In particular, one of the children may not define the constant, and when such child is used, it will satisfy the type, but not the constant definition.
