name = "Abstract Class Constants";
description = "Those are class constants which are defined in multiple children, but not in the parent class.

If this class is a feature of the parent class, or shall and must be defined in the children classes, it is recommended to add them in the parent class, and let them overloaded in the children class.

In the illustration below, ``CONSTA`` is defined in all two children, but not in the parent class. A third children would miss the constants definitions, until an error has been reported.

<?php

class A {
    // no constant
}

class A1 extends A {
    public const CONSTA = 1;
}

class A2 extends A {
    public const CONSTA = 2;
}
