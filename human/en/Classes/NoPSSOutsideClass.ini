name = "self, parent, static Outside Class";
description = "self, parent and static should be called inside a class or trait. PHP lint won't report those situations. 

self, parent and static may be used in a trait : their actual value will be only known at execution time, when the trait is used.

<?php
// In the examples, self, parent and static may be used interchangeably

// This raises a Fatal error
//Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Cannot access static:: when no class scope is active
new static();

// static calls
echo self::CONSTANTE;
echo self::$property;
echo self::method();

// as a type hint
function foo(static $x) {
    doSomething();
}

// as a instanceof
if ($x instanceof static) {
    doSomething();
}

?>

Such syntax problem is only revealed at execution time : PHP raises a Fatal error. 

The origin of the problem is usually a method that was moved outside a class, at least temporarily.
