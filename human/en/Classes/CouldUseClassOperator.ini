name = "Could Use Class Operator";
description = "The class operator is `::class`. With a class name as left operator, it provides the full class name. 

Classes may also be identified with a string, as a fully qualified name. Using the class operator is a more explicit way to do it.

The `::class` operator works with the local use expressions. It also provides a string, which may be further processed.

<?php

use A\B\C;

$a = C::class;
$a = \A\B\C::class; // also valid
$object = new $a(); // object of A\B\C.

// string version
$a = '\a\b\c';
$object = new $a(); // object of A\B\C.

?>

The class operator is also called the 'scope resolution operator'.
