description = "The class operator is `::class`. With a class name as left operator, it provides the full class name. 

Classes may also be identified with a string, as a fully qualified name. Using the class operator is a more explicit way to do it.

The `::class` operator works with the local use expressions. It also provides a string, which may be further processed.
The class operator is also called the 'scope resolution operator'.";
