name = "Throw In Destruct";
description = "According to the manual, ``Attempting to throw an exception from a destructor (called in the time of script termination) causes a fatal error.``

The destructor may be called during the lifespan of the script, but it is not certain. If the exception is thrown later, the script may end up with a fatal error. 

Thus, it is recommended to avoid throwing exceptions within the ``__destruct`` method of a class.";
