name = "Identical Methods";
description = "When the parent class and the child class have the same method, the child might omit it. This reduces code duplication. 

Duplicate code in methods is often the results of code evolution, where a method was copied with the hierarchy, but the original wasn't removed.

This doesn't apply to `private` methods, which are reserved for one class.

class a {
    public function foo() {

    }
}

class b extends a {
    public function foo() {
        return rand(0, 100);
    }
