name = "Mismatch Properties Typehints";
description = "Properties must match within the same family.

When a property is declared both in a parent class, and a child class, they must have the same type. The same type includes a possible null value.

This doesn't apply to private properties, which are only visible locally.

<?php

// property $p is declared as an object of type a
class x { 
    protected A $p; 
}

// property $p is declared again, this time without a type
class a extends x { 
    protected $p; 
}
?>

This code will lint, but not execute.
