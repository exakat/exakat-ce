name = "Cancel Common Method";
description = "A parent method's is too little used in children.

The parent class has a method, which is customised in children classes, though most of the time, those are empty : hence, cancelled. 

<?php

class x {
    abstract function foo();
    abstract function bar();
}

class y1 extends x {
    function foo() { doSomething(); }
    function bar() { doSomething(); };
}

class y2 extends x {
    // foo is cancelled : it must be written, but has no use. 
    function foo() {  }
    function bar() { doSomething(); };
}

?>

A threshold of ``cancelThreshold`` % of the children methods have to be cancelled to report the parent class. By default, it is 75 (or 3 out of 4).
