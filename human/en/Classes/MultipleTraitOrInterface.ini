Up to PHP 7.4, this doesn't raise any warning. Traits are only imported once, and interfaces may be implemented as many times as wanted.

Since PHP 7.4, multiple implementations of the same interface in one class is reported at compilation time. It is possible to repeat the implementation in various levels of a class hierarchy (aka, same implements in a class and a parent). 

<?php

class foo {
    use aTrait, aTrait, aTrait;
    use aTrait;
}

class bar implements anInterface, anInterface, anInterface {

}
