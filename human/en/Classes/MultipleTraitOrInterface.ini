description = "There is no need to use the same trait, or implements the same interface more than once in a class.

Up to PHP 7.4, this doesn't raise any warning. Traits are only imported once, and interfaces may be implemented as many times as wanted.

Since PHP 7.4, multiple implementations of the same interface in one class is reported at compilation time. It is possible to repeat the implementation in various levels of a class hierarchy (aka, same implements in a class and a parent).

This only applies in a single class: there are no checks in a class, or interface hierarchy.
