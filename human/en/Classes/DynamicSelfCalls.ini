name = "Dynamic Self Calls";
description = "A class that calls itself dynamically. This may be property or methods. 

Calling itself dynamically happens when a class is configured to call various properties (container) or methods.  

<?php

class x {
    function foo() {
        $f = 'goo';
        return $this->$f();
    }

    function goo() {
        return rand(1, 10);
    }
}
?>

This rule is mostly useful internally, to side some special situations.
