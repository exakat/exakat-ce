name = "Unreachable Class Constant";
description = "Class constants may be unreachable due to visibility configuration. 

Since PHP 7.1, class constants support visibility. Their usage may be restricted to the current class, or ``private``, to classes that extends or are extended by the current class, or ``protected``. They may also be ``public``, just like it was before. 

<?php

class Foo{
    private const PRIVATE = 1;
            const PUBLIC = 3;
}

// PHP 7.1- and older
echo Foo::PUBLIC;

// This is not accessible
echo Foo::PRIVATE;
