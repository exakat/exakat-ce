name = "Empty Classes";
description = "Classes that do no define anything at all : no property, method nor constant. This is possibly dead code.

Empty classes are sometimes used to group classes; an interface may be used here for the same purpose, without inserting an extra level in the class hierarchy.

<?php

//Empty class
class foo extends bar {}

//Not an empty class
class foo2 extends bar {
    const FOO = 2;
}

//Not an empty class, as derived from Exception
class barException extends \Exception {}

?>

Classes that are directly derived from an exception are omitted.
