name = "Unused Private Methods";
description = "Private methods that are not used in the local class are dead code. Protected methods that are not used in the local class or its children, are dead code.

Private methods are reserved for the defining class. Thus, they must be used with the current class, with ``$this`` or ``self::``.

Protected methods, in a standalone class, are also included.


<?php

class Foo {
    // Those methods are used
    private function method() {}
    private static function staticMethod() {}

    // Those methods are not used
    private function unusedMethod() {}
    private static function staticUnusedMethod() {}
    
    public function bar() {
        self::staticMethod();
        $this->method();
    }
}

?>

This analysis skips classes that makes self dynamic calls, such as ``$this->$method()``.
