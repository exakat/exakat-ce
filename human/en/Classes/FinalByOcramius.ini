When a class should be final, as explained by ``Ocramius`` (``Marco Pivetta``).

<?php

interface i1 {
    function i1() ;
}

// Class should final, as its public methods are in an interface
class finalClass implements i1 {
    // public interface 
    function i1 () {}
    
    // private method
    private function a1 () {}
}

?>
