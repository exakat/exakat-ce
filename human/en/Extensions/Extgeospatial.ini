description = "PHP Extension to handle common geospatial functions. The extension currently has implementations of the Haversine and Vincenty's formulas for calculating distances, an initial bearing calculation function, a Helmert transformation function to transfer between different supported datums, conversions between polar and Cartesian coordinates, conversions between Degree/Minute/Seconds and decimal degrees, a method to simplify linear geometries, as well as a method to calculate intermediate points on a LineString.
