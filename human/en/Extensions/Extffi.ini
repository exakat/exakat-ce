description = "Extension ``FFI`` : Foreign Function Interface .

This extension allows the loading of shared libraries (.DLL or .so), calling of C functions and accessing of C data structures in pure PHP, without having to have deep knowledge of the Zend extension API, and without having to learn a third “intermediate” language. The public API is implemented as a single class FFI with several static methods (some of them may be called dynamically), and overloaded object methods, which perform the actual interaction with C data.

<?php
//Example : Calling a function from shared library
// create FFI object, loading libc and exporting function printf()
$ffi = FFI::cdef(
    \"int printf(const char *format, ...);\", // this is a regular C declaration
    \"libc.so.6\");
// call C's printf()
$ffi->printf(\"Hello %s!\n\", \"world\");
?>
