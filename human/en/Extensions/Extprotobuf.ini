Protocol Buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. 

<?php

// Example extracted from https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/php-generated

// given a simple message 
//message Foo {}

/*
The protocol buffer compiler generates a PHP class called Foo. This class inherits from a common base class, Google\\Protobuf\\Internal\\Message, which provides methods for encoding and decoding your message types, as shown in the following example:
*/

$from = new Foo();
$from->setInt32(1);
$from->setString('a');
$from->getRepeatedInt32()[] = 1;
$from->getMapInt32Int32()[1] = 1;
$data = $from->serializeToString();
try {
  $to->mergeFromString($data);
} catch (Exception $e) {
  // Handle parsing error from invalid data.
  ...
}
