The goal of the project is to be able to run WebAssembly binaries from PHP directly. So much fun coming!

From the php-ext-wasm documentation : 

<?php

//There is a toy program in examples/simple.rs, written in Rust (or any other language that compiles to WASM):
// Stored in file __DIR__ . '/simple.wasm'
/*
#[no_mangle]
pub extern \"C\" fn sum(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
*/

$instance = new WASM\\Instance(__DIR__ . '/simple.wasm');

var_dump(
    $instance->sum(5, 37) // 42!
);

?>
