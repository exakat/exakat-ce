Shmop is an easy to use set of functions that allows PHP to read, write, create and delete Unix shared memory segments.

<?php
// Create a temporary file and return its path
$tmp = tempnam('/tmp', 'PHP');

// Get the file token key
$key = ftok($tmp, 'a');

// Attach the SHM resource, notice the cast afterwards
$id = shm_attach($key);

if ($id === false) {
    die('Unable to create the shared memory segment');
}

// Cast to integer, since prior to PHP 5.3.0 the resource id 
// is returned which can be exposed when casting a resource
// to an integer
$id = (integer) $id;
?>
