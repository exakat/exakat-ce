description = "Extension ext-memcached.

This extension uses the libmemcached library to provide an API for communicating with memcached servers. It also provides a session handler (`memcached`).

<?php
$m = new Memcached();
$m->addServer('localhost', 11211);

$m->set('foo', 100);
var_dump($m->get('foo'));
?>
