description = "Constants Created Outside Its Namespace.

Using the define() function, it is possible to create constant outside their namespace, but using the fully qualified namespace.

<?php

namespace A\B {
    // define A\B\C as 1
    define('C', 1);
}

namespace D\E {
    // define A\B\C as 1, while outside the A\B namespace
    define('A\B\C', 1);
}

?>

However, this makes the code confusing and difficult to debug. It is recommended to move the constant definition to its namespace.";
