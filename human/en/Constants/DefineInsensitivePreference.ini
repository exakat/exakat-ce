description = "Define() creates constants which are case sensitive or not. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make constant sensitivity definition consistent. 

Note that define() used to allow the creation of case-sensitive constants, but this is deprecated since PHP 7.3 and will be removed in PHP 8.0.
