name = "Const Or Define Preference";
description = "``Const`` and define() have almost the same functional use : they create constants. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make constant definition consistent. 

It is recommended to use ``const`` for global constants, as this keyword is processed at compile time, while define() is executed.

Note that define() used to allow the creation of case-insensitive constants, but this is deprecated since PHP 7.3 and will be removed in PHP 8.0.
