name = "Invalid Constant Name";
description = "There is a naming convention for PHP constants names. 

According to PHP's manual, constant names, ' A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.'.

Constant, must follow this regex : ``/[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*/``.

In particular when defined using define() function, no error is produced. When using ``const``, on the other hand, the name must be valid at linting time. 

<?php

define('+3', 1); // wrong constant name! 

echo constant('+3'); // invalid constant access

// This won't compile, with a syntax error.
// const 3A = 3;

?>
