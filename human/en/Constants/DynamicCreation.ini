description = "Registering constant with dynamic values. Dynamic values include values read in external sources (files, databases, remote API, ... ), random sources (time, rand(), ...)

Dynamic constants are not possible with the ``const`` keyword, though static constant expression allows for a good range of combinations, including conditions.
