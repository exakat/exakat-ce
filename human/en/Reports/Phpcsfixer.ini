`PHP-cs-fixer <https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer>`_ is a tool to automatically fix PHP Coding Standards issues. Some of the modifications are more than purely coding standards, such has replacing ``dirname(dirname($path))`` with ``dirname($path, 2)``. 

Exakat builds a configuration file for php-cs-fixer, that will automatically fix a number of results from the audit. Here is the process : 

+ Run exakat audit
+ Get Phpcsfixer report from exakat : ``php exakat.phar report -p <project> -format Phpcsfixer``
+ Update the target repository in the generated code
+ Save this new configuration in a file called '.php_cs'
+ Run php-cs-fixer on your code : ``php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/code --dry-run``
+ Fixed your code with php-cs-fixer : ``php php-cs-fixer.phar fix /path/to/code``
+ Run a new exakat audit

This configuration file should be reviewed before being used. In particular, the target files should be updated with the actual repository : this is the first part of the configuration. 

It is also recommended to use the option '--dry-run' with php-cs-fixer to check the first run. 

Php-cs-fixer runs fixes for coding standards : this reports focuses on potential fixes. It is recommended to complete this base report with extra coding conventions fixes. The building of a coding convention is outside the scope of this report. 

Exakat may find different issues than php-cs-fixer : using this report reduces the number of reported issues, but may leave some issues unsolved. In that case, manual fixing is recommended.
