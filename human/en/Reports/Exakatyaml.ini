description = "Exakatyaml helpls with the configuration of exakat in a CI. It builds a list of ruleset, based on the number of issues from the previous audit.

Continuous Integration require steps that yield no issues. This is good for analysis that yield no results : in a word, all analysis that are currently clean should be in the CI. That way, any return will be monitored.

On the other hand, other analysis that currently yield issues needs to be fully cleaned before usage.
