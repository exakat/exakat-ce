description = "This report displays all dependencies between classes, interfaces and traits. A class (or interface or trait) depends on another class (or interface or trait) when it makes usage of one of its definitions : extends, implements, use, and static calls. 

For example, `A` depends on `B`, because `A` extends `B`.

Warning : large applications (> 1000 classes) will require a lot of resources to open.";
