description = "The Rector report is a helper report for `Tomas Votruba <https://twitter.com/VotrubaT>`_'s `Rector <https://getrector.org/>`_ tool.

Some issues spotted by Exakat may be fixed automagically by Rector. Rector offers more than 550 (and counting) rules, that may save countless hours of work. 

For example, `CombinedAssignRector <https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/master/docs/AllRectorsOverview.md#combinedassignrector>`_, simplifies ``$value = $value + 5`` into ``+$value += 5;``. On Exakat, the rule `Structures/CouldUseShortAssignation <(https://exakat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rules.html#could-use-short-assignation>`_ spot those too.

Not all exakat rules are covered by Rector, and vice-versa. `CompactToVariablesRector <https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/blob/master/docs/AllRectorsOverview.md#compacttovariablesrector>`_ aims Ã  skipping usage of compact(), while `Structures/CouldUseCompact <https://exakat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rules.html#could-use-compact>`_ suggest the contrary. 

Rector and Exakat both use different approaches to code review. It is recommended to review the changes before commiting them.
