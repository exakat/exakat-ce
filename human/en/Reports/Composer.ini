This report makes a copy then updates the composer.json, when available; otherwise, it creates a totally new composer.json. 

The report provides a calculated value for \"php\": \"^7.3\" and all the identified PHP extensions (such as \"ext-exif\", \"ext-gd\", \"ext-finfo\", etc). Core PHP extensions are omitted. 

It is recommended to review manually the results of the suggested composer.json before using it.
