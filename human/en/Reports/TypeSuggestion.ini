description = "The TypeSuggestion offers suggestions to add typehints to methods and properties. 

It provides its suggestion based on the way the code is implemented : by usage or by calling.

Type usage is the way a typed container is use later. For example, an argument that is used later with the array syntax ``$x['a']`` or as an object ``$x->b``will receive a suggestion for using array or object.

Type calling is the way the typed container is assigned. For example, a property may receive integer or boolean during assignations : they will receive such suggestions. 

Not all types can be guessed : for example, a property may simply hold a value, for later use, such as in a cache system. In such situation, no type is suggested.

``mixed`` is not used as suggestion : rather a list of possible types is offered, and it may be upgraded to ``mixed``. 

This report is ready for PHP 8.0 : the suggestions may be combined together, and multiples suggestions are possible.
