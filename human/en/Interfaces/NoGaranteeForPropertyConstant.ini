name = "Interfaces Don't Ensure Properties";
description = "When using an interface as a type, properties are not enforced, nor available.

An interface is a template for a class, which specify the minimum amount of methods and constants. Properties are never defined in an interface, and should not be relied upon.

<?php

interface i {
    function m () ;
}

class x implements i {
    public $p = 1;
    
    function m() {
        return $this->p;
    }
}

function foo(i $i, x $x) {
    // this is invalid, as $p is not defined in i, so it may be not available
    echo $i->p;
    
    // this is valid, as $p is defined in $x
    echo $x->p;
}
