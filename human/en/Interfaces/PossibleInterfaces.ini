name = "Possible Interfaces";
description = "This analyzer lists classes that may be a base to create interfaces. 

Currently, classes with more than 1 defined method are used to identify possible interfaces. An interfaces are considered when at least 2 methods are common in 3 classes.

Only the name of the method is used to identify possible methodes. Signature and method options are not taken into account.

class a {
    function m1 () {}
    function m2 () {}
    function m3 () {}
}

class b {
    function m1 () {}
    function m2 () {}
    function m4 () {}
}

// This class has not enough shared methods with other classes
class c {
    function m1 () {}
    function m4 () {}
    function m5 () {}
}
