name = "Repeated Interface";
description = "A class should implements only once an interface. An interface can only extends once another interface. In both cases, parent classes or interfaces must be checked.

PHP accepts multiple times the same interface in the ``implements`` clause. In fact, it doesn't do anything beyond the first implement. 

<?php

use i as j;

interface i {}

// Multiple ways to reference an interface
class foo implements i, \i, j {}

// This applies to interfaces too
interface bar extends i, \i, j {}

?>

This code may compile, but won't execute.
