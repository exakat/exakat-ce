name = "Use PHP7 Encapsed Strings";
description = "PHP 7 has optimized the handling of double-quoted strings. In particular, double-quoted strings are much less memory hungry than classic concatenations. 

PHP allocates memory at the end of the double-quoted string, making only one call to the allocator. On the other hand, concatenations are allocated each time they include dynamic content, leading to higher memory consumption. 

<?php

$bar = 'bar';
 
/* PHP 7 optimized this */
$a = \"foo and $bar\";
 
/* This is PHP 5 code (aka, don't use it) */
$a = 'foo and ' . $bar;

// Constants can't be used with double quotes
$a = 'foo and ' . __DIR__;
$a = "foo and __DIR__"; // __DIR__ is not interpolated

?>

Concatenations are still needed with constants, static constants, magic constants, functions, static properties or static methods.
