name = "Use PHP7 Encapsed Strings";
description = "PHP 7 has optimized the handling of double-quoted strings. In particular, double-quoted strings are much less memory hungry than classic concatenations. 

PHP allocates memory at the end of the double-quoted string, making only one call to the allocator. On the other hand, concatenations are allocated each time they include dynamic content, leading to higher memory consumption. 
Concatenations are still needed with constants, static constants, magic constants, functions, static properties or static methods.";
