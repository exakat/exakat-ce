name = "Avoid array_push()";
description = "array_push() is slower than the append ``[]`` operator.

This is also true when the append operator is called several times, while array_push() is be called only once, with an arbitrary number of argument. 

Using count after the push is also faster than collecting array_push() return value. 

<?php

$a = [1,2,3];
// Fast version
$a[] = 4;

$a[] = 5;
$a[] = 6;
$a[] = 7;
$count = count($a);

// Slow version
array_push($a, 4);
$count = array_push($a, 5,6,7);

// Multiple version : 
$a[] = 1;
$a[] = 2;
$a[] = 3;
array_push($a, 1, 2, 3);

?>

It is a micro-optimisation.
