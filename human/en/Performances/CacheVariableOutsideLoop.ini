name = "Cache Variable Outside Loop";
description = "Avoid recalculating constant values inside the loop.

Do the calculation once, outside the loops, and then reuse the value each time. 

One of the classic example if doing ``count($array)`` in a ``for`` loop : since the source is constant during the loop, the result of count() is always the same. 

<?php

$path = '/some/path';
$fullpath = realpath(\"$path/more/dirs/\");
foreach($files as $file) {
    // Only moving parts are used in the loop
    copy($file, $fullpath.$file);
}

$path = '/some/path';
foreach($files as $file) {
    // $fullpath is calculated each loop
    $fullpath = realpath(\"$path/more/dirs/\");
    copy($file, $fullpath.$file);
}

?>

Depending on the load of the called method, this may increase the speed of the loop from little to enormously.
