description = "When in a loop, it is faster to rely on the blind var, rather than the original source.

When the key is referenced in the foreach loop, it is faster to use the available container to access a value for reading.

Note that it is also faster to use the value with a reference to handle the writings.

    $coordinates = array('x' => $source[$key][0],
