name = "array_key_exists() Speedup";
description = "array_key_exists() has its own opcode, leading to better features and speed.

isset() is faster for all non-empty values, but is limited when the value is NULL or empty : then, array_key_exists() has the good features.

``This change makes array_key_exists() actually faster than isset() by ~25% (tested with GCC 8, -O3, march=native, mtune=native).``.

<?php

$foo = [123 => 456];

// This is sufficient and efficient since PHP 7.4
if (array_search_key($foo[123])) {
    // do something
}

// taking advantages of performances for PHP 7.4 and older
if (isset($foo[123]) || array_search_key($foo[123])) {
    // do something
}
