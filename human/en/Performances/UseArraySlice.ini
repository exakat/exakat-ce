name = "Use array_slice()";
description = "Array_slice is de equivalent of substr() for arrays.

array_splice() is also possible, to remove a portion of array inside the array, not at the ends. This has no equivalent for strings.

<?php

$array = range(0, 9);

// Extract the 5 first elements
print_r(array_slice($array, 0, 5));

// Extract the 4 last elements
print_r(array_slice($array, -4));

// Extract the 2 central elements : 4 and 5
print_r(array_splice($array, 4, 2));

// slow way to remove the last elementst of an array
for($i = 0; $i < 4) {
    array_pop($array);
}

?>
