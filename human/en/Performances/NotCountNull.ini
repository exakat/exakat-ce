name = "No Count With 0";
description = "Comparing count(), strlen() or mb_strlen() to 0 is a waste of resources. There are three distinct situations.

When comparing count() with 0, with ===, ==, !==, !=, it is more efficient to use empty(). empty() is a language construct that checks if a value is present, while count() actually load the number of element.

<?php

// Checking if an array is empty
if (count($array) == 0) {
    // doSomething();
}
// This may be replaced with 
if (empty($array)) {
    // doSomething();
}

?>

When comparing count() strictly with 0 and ``>``, it is more efficient to use ``!(empty(  ))``

<?php

// Checking if an array is empty
if (count($array) > 0) {
    // doSomething();
}
// This may be replaced with 
if (!empty($array)) {
    // doSomething();
}

Of course comparing count() with negative values, or with >= is useless.

<?php

// Checking if an array is empty
if (count($array) < 0) {
    // This never happens
    // doSomething();
}

?>

Comparing count(), strlen() or mb_strlen() with other values than 0 cannot be replaced with a comparison with empty().

Note that this is a micro-optimisation : since PHP keeps track of the number of elements in arrays (or number of chars in strings), the total computing time of both operations is often lower than a ms. However, both functions tends to be heavily used, and may even be used inside loops.
