name = "Substr() In Loops";
description = "Successive substr() calls may be replaced by a call to str_split(). 

It speeds up the processing, and allows the replacement of indefinite loops by a foreach() call. 

<?php

$bits = str_split($string, 5);
foreach($bits as $bit) {
	foo($bit);
}

$i = 0;
$s = strlen($string);
while($i < $s) {
	// repeating calls to substr during the loop
	foo(substr($string, $i * 5, 5));
	$i += 5;
}

?>

This is a micro optimisation. It works better on longer strings.
