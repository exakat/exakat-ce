name = "Joining file()";
description = "Use file() to read lines separately. 

Applying ``join('', )`` or ``implode('', )`` to the result of file() provides the same results than using file_get_contents(), but at a higher cost of memory and processing.

If the delimiter is not ``''``, then ``implode()`` and ``file()`` are a better solution than ``file_get_contents()`` and ``str_replace()`` or ``nl2br()``.

Always use ``file_get_contents()`` to get the content of a file as a string. Consider using readfile() to echo the content directly to the output.

This analysis also checks for the reverse feature: loading a file with ``file_get_contents()`` and splitting it into rows with ``explode()`` or an alternative. Such association should be replaced by a single call to ``file()``, with may be the ``FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES``.
