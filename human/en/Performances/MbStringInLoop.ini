name = "No mb_substr In Loop";
description = "Do not use loops on mb_substr(). 

mb_substr() always starts at the beginning of the string to search for the nth char, and recalculate everything. This means that the first iterations are as fast as substr() (for comparison), while the longer the string, the slower mb_substr().

The recommendation is to use preg_split() with the `u` option, to split the string into an array. This save multiple recalculations.";

// Split the string by characters

// Slow version
$nb = mb_strlen($mb);
for($i = 0; $i < $nb; ++$i) {
    // Fetch a character
    $c = mb_substr($string, $i, 1);
