name = "Simple Switch And Match";
description = "Switch() and match() are faster when relying only on literal integers or strings.

Since PHP 7.2, simple switches, that use only literal strings or integers, are optimized. The bigger the switch, the greater the gain.
Match() was introduced in PHP 8.0

In particular, this optimisation doesn't work with any expressions (constant or not), function call, methodcall, constant usage, etc. Only literal values, string or integer.

When the switch is partially build of literals, it is worth splitting the switch in two : first level, only with the literal cases, and, in the default, the dynamic values. This brings some performances, though it is a micro-optimisation.";
