name = "Memoize MagicCall";
description = "Cache calls to magic methods in local variable. Local cache is faster than calling again the magic method as soon as the second call, provided that the value hasn't changed.

``__get`` is slower, as it turns a simple member access into a full method call. 

<?php

class x {
    private $values = array();
    
    function __get($name) {
        return $this->values[$name];
    }
    // more code to set values to this class
}

function foo(x $b) {
    $a = $b->a; 
    $c = $b->c;
    
    $d = $c;     // using local cache, no new access to $b->__get($name)
    $e = $b->a;  // Second access to $b->a, through __get
}

function bar(x $b) {
    $a = $b->a; 
    $c = $b->c;
    
    $b->bar2(); // this changes $b->a and $b->c, but we don't see it
    
    $d = $b->c; 
    $e = $b->a;  // Second access to $b->a, through __get
}

?>

The caching is not possible if the processing of the object changes the value of the property.
