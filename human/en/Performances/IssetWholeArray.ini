name = "Isset() On The Whole Array";
description = "Isset() works quietly on a whole array. There is no need to test all previous index before testing for the target index.

It also works on chained properties. 
There is a gain in readability, by avoiding long and hard to read logical expression, and reducing them in one simple isset() call.

There is a gain in performances by using one call to isset(), instead of several. It is a micro-optimization.";
