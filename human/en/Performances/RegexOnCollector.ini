name = "Processing Collector";
description = "When accumulating data in a variable, within a loop, it is slow to apply repeatedly a function to the variable.

The example below illustrate the problem : ``$collector`` is build with element from ``$array``. ``$collector`` actually gets larger and larger, slowing the in_array() call each time. 

It is better to apply the preg_replace() to ``$a``, a short variable, and then, add ``$a`` to the collector.

<?php

// Fast way
$collector = '';
foreach($array as $a){
    $a = preg_replace('/__(.*?)__/', '<b>$1</b>', $a);
    $collector .= $a;
}

// Slow way
$collector = '';
foreach($array as $a){
    $collector .= $a;
    $collector = preg_replace('/__(.*?)__/', '<b>$1</b>', $collector);
}

?>
