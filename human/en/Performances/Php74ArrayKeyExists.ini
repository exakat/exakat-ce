name = "Always Use Function With array_key_exists()";
description = "array_key_exists() has been granted a special virtual machine opcode, and is much faster. This applies to PHP 7.4 and more recent. 

It requires that array_key_exists() is statically resolved, either with an initial ``\``, or a ``use function`` expression. This doesn't affect the global namespace.
This analysis is related to Php/ShouldUseFunction, and is a special case, that only concerns array_key_exists().";
code = "<?php

namespace my/name/space;

// do not forget the 'function' keyword, or it will apply to classes.
use function array_key_exists as foo; // the alias is not necessary, and may be omitted.

// array_key_exists is aliased to foo : 
$c = foo($a, $b);

// This call requires a fallback to global, and will be slow.
$c = array_key_exists($a, $b);
