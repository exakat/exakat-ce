A parameter is one slot in the method definition. An argument is a slot in the method call. Both are linked by the method and their respective position in the argument list.

+ Total number of argument usage, linked to a parameter : this excludes arguments from external libraries and native PHP functions. For reference.
+ Number of identical parameter : cases where argument and parameter have the same name. 
+ Number of different parameter : cases where argument and parameter have the different name. 
+ Number of expression argument : cases where argument is an expression
+ Number of constant argument : cases where the argument is a constant";
