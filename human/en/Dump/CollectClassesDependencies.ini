description = "This rule collects class dependencies. Each call to one or the other resource put forward by a class creates a link between two points in the code. 

Class dependencies are based on typehint, calls (static or normal), instanceof, catch, attributes, extends. 

The result is a graph of dependencies : some classes depends on others, and vice-versa. ";
