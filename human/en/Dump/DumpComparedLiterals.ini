Comparisons include all the comparison operators : <, >, <=, >=, !=, <>, ==.

This analysis also covers switch(), array_keys() and in_array(). 

Strict searches are omitted. So, ===, !==, match(), in_array() and array_keys() with 3rd parameter are omitted.

Some comparisons are not covered yet : sort().";
