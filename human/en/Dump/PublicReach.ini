Each internal is reported here, with the origin and destination. When connecting the calls from methods to method, it is possible to draw the path from public methods to private methods.

This class map is useful to prepare tests and improve coverage by targeting public methods that may use restricted methods.

Note that conditions will apply (pun intended) : a link between two methods only means that one may call the other, given the right conditions.";
