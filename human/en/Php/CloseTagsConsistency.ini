name = "Close Tags Consistency";
description = "PHP scripts may omit the final closing tag. 

This is a convention, used to avoid the infamous 'headers already sent' error message, that appears when a script with extra invisible spaces is included before actually emitting the headers.

The PHP manual recommends : "If a file is pure PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file.". (See `PHP Tags <https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php>`_)
