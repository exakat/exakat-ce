description = "Named parameter with variadic have been renamed from 0 to 'parameter name' in PHP 8.0.
In PHP 7.0, with positional argument only, the content of $b is in an array, index 0. This is also true with PHP 8.0.

In PHP 8.0, with named arguments, the content of $b is in an array, index 'b';

Since the behavior of the variadic depends on the calling syntax (with or without named parameter), the receiving must ensure the correct reception, and handle both cases.";
