<?php

function foo($a, ...$b) {
    print_r($b);
}

foo(3, 4);
foo(3, b: 4);              // PHP 8 only 
foo(...[2, "b"=> [3, 4]]); // PHP 8 only 

?>

In PHP 7.0, with positional argument only, the content of $b is in an array, index 0. This is also true with PHP 8.0.

In PHP 8.0, with named arguments, the content of $b is in an array, index 'b';

Since the behavior of the variadic depends on the calling syntax (with or without named parameter), the receiving must ensure the correct reception, and handle both cases.
