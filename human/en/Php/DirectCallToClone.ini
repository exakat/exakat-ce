description = "Direct call to magic method ``__clone()`` was forbidden. It is allowed since PHP 7.0. 

From the RFC : ``Doing calls like $obj->__clone( ) is now allowed. This was the only magic method that had a compile-time check preventing some calls to it, which doesn't make sense. If we allow all other magic methods to be called, there's no reason to forbid this one``.
