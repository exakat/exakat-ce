name = "Use PHP Object API";
description = "OOP API is the modern version of the PHP API.

When PHP offers the alternative between procedural and OOP api for the same features, it is recommended to use the OOP API. 

Often, this least to more compact code, as methods are shorter, and there is no need to bring the resource around. Lots of new extensions are directly written in OOP form too.

OOP / procedural alternatives are available for `mysqli <https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php>`_, `tidy <https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.tidy.php>`_, `cairo <https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.cairo.php>`_, `finfo <https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.fileinfo.php>`_, and some others.";
