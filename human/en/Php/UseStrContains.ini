description = "str_contains() checks if a string is within another one. It replaces a call to strpos() with a comparison. 
Note that this function is case sensitive : it cannot replace stripos().

Note that this function is single-byte only : it cannot replace mb_strpos().

This analysis omits calls to strpos() that are saved to a variable. strpos() is actually returning the position of the found string in the haystack, which may be reused later.";
