name = "Openssl Encrypt Default Algorithm Change";
description = "openssl_pkcs7_encrypt() and openssl_cms_encrypt() will now default to using AES-128-CBC rather than RC2-40. The RC2-40 cipher is considered insecure and not enabled by default in OpenSSL 3.

This means that the default argument of OPENSSL_CIPHER_RC2_40 is replaced by OPENSSL_CIPHER_AES_128_CBC.
