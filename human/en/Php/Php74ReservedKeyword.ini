name = "PHP 7.4 Reserved Keyword";
description = "``fn`` is a new PHP keyword. In PHP 7.4, it is used to build the arrow functions. When used at an illegal position, ``fn`` generates a Fatal error at compile time.

As a key word, ``fn`` is not allowed as constant name, function name, class name or inside namespaces. 

<?php

// PHP 7.4 usage of fn
function array_values_from_keys($arr, $keys) {
    return array_map(fn($x) => $arr[$x], $keys);
}

// PHP 7.3 usage of fn
const fn = 1;

function fn() {}

class x {
    // This is valid in PHP 7.3 and 7.4
    function fn() {}
}

?>

``fn`` is fine for method names. It may also be used for constants with define(), and constant() but it is not recommended.
