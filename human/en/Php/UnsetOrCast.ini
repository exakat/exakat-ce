name = "Unset() Or (unset)";
description = "Unset() and (unset) have the same functional use. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that unset() or (unset) are used depending on coding style and files. One file may be consistently using unset(), while the others are all using (unset). 

In PHP 8.0, the cast ``(unset)`` is not available anymore. It is recomended to avoid using it.
