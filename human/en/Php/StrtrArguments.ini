name = "Strtr Arguments";
description = "Strtr() replaces characters by others in a string. When using strings, strtr() replaces characters as long as they have a replacement. All others are ignored.

In particular, strtr() works on strings of the same size, and cannot be used to remove chars.

<?php

$string = 'abcde';
echo strtr($string, 'abc', 'AB');
echo strtr($string, 'ab', 'ABC');
// displays ABcde 
// c is ignored each time

// strtr can't remove a char
echo strtr($string, 'a', '');
// displays a

?>

explain="This code prepares incoming '$values' for extraction. The keys are cleaned then split with explode(). The '=' sign would stay, as strtr() can't remove it. This means that such keys won't be recognized later in the code, and gets omitted."
