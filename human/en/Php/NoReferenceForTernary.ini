description = "The ternary operator and the null coalescing operator are both expressions that only return values, and not a reference. 

This means that any provided reference will be turned into its value. While this is usually invisible, it will raise a warning when a reference is expected. This is the case with methods returning a reference. 

A PHP notice is generated when using a ternary operator or the null coalesce operator : ``Only variable references should be returned by reference``. The notice is also emitted when returning objects. 

This applies to methods, functions and closures.";
