description = "Avoid defining an ``assert`` function in namespaces. 

While they work fine when the assertions are active (``zend.assertions=1``), calls to unqualified ``assert`` are optimized away when assertions are not active. 

Since PHP 7.3, a fatal error is emitted : ``Defining a custom assert() function is deprecated, as the function has special semantics``.
