description = "PHP has two sets of logical operators : letters (and, or, xor) and chars (&&, ||, ^). 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of the two sets : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

Warning : the two sets of operators have different precedence levels. Using and or && is not exactly the same, especially and not only, when assigning the results to a variable. 
Using and or && are also the target of other analysis.";
