description = "``FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES`` is deprecated. In PHP 7.4, it should be replaced with addslashes()

According to the migration RDFC : 'Magic quotes were deprecated all the way back in PHP 5.3 and later removed in PHP 5.4. The filter extension implements a sanitization filter that mimics this behavior of magic_quotes by calling addslashes() on the input in question.'

<?php

// Deprecated way to filter input
$var = filter_input($input, FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES);

// Alternative way to filter input
$var = addslashes($input);

?>

addslashes() used to filter data while building SQL queries, to prevent injections. Nowadays, prepared queries are a better option.
