According to the migration RDFC : 'Magic quotes were deprecated all the way back in PHP 5.3 and later removed in PHP 5.4. The filter extension implements a sanitization filter that mimics this behavior of magic_quotes by calling addslashes() on the input in question.'
addslashes() used to filter data while building SQL queries, to prevent injections. Nowadays, prepared queries are a better option.";
