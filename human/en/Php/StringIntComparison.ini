name = "String Int Comparison";
description = "While PHP allows direct comparison of integer and strings, with some type conversion, the rules of conversion changed in PHP 8.0. This lead to a change in behavior for comparison.

In particular, strings that are equal to 0, or empty strings, have changed.

This doesn't affect identity comparison, since the type is initially checked.
