name = "PHP 8.1 Removed Directives";
description = "List of directives that are removed in PHP 8.1.

In PHP 8.1, the following directives were removed : 

* `mysqlnd.fetch_data_copy`
* `filter.default`
* `filter.default_options`
* `auto_detect_line_endings`
* `oci8.old_oci_close_semantics`

You can detect valid directives with ini_get(). This native function will return false, when the directive doesn't exist, while actual directive values will be returned as a string. 

See `PHP RFC: Deprecations for PHP 8.1 <https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_1>`_.
