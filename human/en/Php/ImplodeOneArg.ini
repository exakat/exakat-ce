description = "implode() may be called with one arg. It is recommended to avoid it. 

Using two arguments makes it less surprising to new comers, and consistent with explode() syntax.

print implode('', $array);

// only the array : PHP uses the empty string as glue. 
// Avoid this
print implode($array);

?>
