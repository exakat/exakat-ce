description = "List of directives that are removed in PHP 8.0.

In PHP 8.0, `track_errors` was removed. 

You can detect valid directives with ini_get(). This native function will return false, when the directive doesn't exist, while actual directive values will be returned as a string. 

See `Deprecation track_errors <https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.incompatible.php`_.
