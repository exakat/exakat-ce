description = "$GLOBALS access, as whole, is forbidden. In PHP 8.1, it is not possible to this as a variable, but only access its individual values.

<?php
// Example extracted from the RFC (see link below)
// Continues to work:
foreach ($GLOBALS as $var => $value) {
    echo $var . ' => ' . $value . PHP_EOL;
}

// Generates compile-time error:
$GLOBALS = [];
$GLOBALS += [];
$GLOBALS =& $x;
$x =& $GLOBALS;
unset($GLOBALS);
