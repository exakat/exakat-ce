name = "Not A Scalar Type";
description = "``int`` is the actual PHP scalar type, not ``integer``. 

PHP 7 introduced several scalar types, in particular ``int``, ``bool``, ``string`` and ``float``. Those three types are easily mistaken with ``integer``, ``boolean``, ``real`` and ``double``. 

Unless those classes actually exists, PHP emits some strange error messages.
Thanks to ``Benoit Viguier`` for the `original idea <https://twitter.com/b_viguier/status/940173951908700161>`__ for this analysis.";
