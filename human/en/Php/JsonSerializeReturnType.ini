name = "PHP Native Interfaces and Return Type";
description = "Native PHP interface which define a type, expect the derived methods to use the same time. In particular, a mixed return type was added to the jsonSerialize() of the JsonSerialize PHP interface. 

In PHP 8.1, the mixed return type is now enforced, and a deprecated notice is displayed.

One solution is to add the good return type, or to use the `#[ReturnTypeWillChange]` attribute.
This rule covers the following interfaces : 

+ ArrayAccess
+ Countable
+ Exception
+ FilterIterator
+ Iterator
+ JsonSerializable
+ php_user_filter
