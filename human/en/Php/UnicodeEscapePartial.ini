name = "Unicode Escape Partial";
description = "PHP 7 introduces a new escape sequence for strings : \u{hex}. It is backward incompatible with previous PHP versions for two reasons : 

PHP 7 will recognize en replace those sequences, while PHP 5 keep them intact.
PHP 7 will halt on partial Unicode Sequences, as it tries to understand them, but may fail. 

<?php

echo \u{1F418}\n; 
// PHP 5 displays the same string
// PHP 7 displays : an elephant

echo \u{NOT A UNICODE CODEPOINT}\n; 
// PHP 5 displays the same string
// PHP 7 emits a fatal error

?>

Is is recommended to check all those strings, and make sure they will behave correctly in PHP 7. ";
