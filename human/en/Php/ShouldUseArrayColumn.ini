description = "Avoid writing a whole slow loop, and use the native array_column().

array_column() is a native PHP function, that extract a property or a index from a array of object, or a multidimensional array. This prevents the usage of foreach to collect those values.

<?php

$a = array(array('b' => 1), 
           array('b' => 2, 'c' => 3), 
           array(          'c' => 4)); // b doesn't always exists

$bColumn = array_column($a, 'b');

// Slow and cumbersome code
$bColumn = array();
foreach($a as $k => $v) {
    if (isset($v['b'])) {
        $bColumn[] = $v['b'];
    }
}

?>

array_column() is faster than foreach() (with or without the isset() test) with 3 elements or more, and it is significantly faster beyond 5 elements. Memory consumption is the same.
