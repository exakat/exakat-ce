description = "Among the different variable interpolation is strings, ``${ expression }`` is deprecated. It is made obsolete in PHP 8.2, and should disappear in PHP 9.0.

There are still several interpolation ways : variables, array elements (one index-level) and curly brackets. It is also possible to use string concatenation.

$a = 'a';
$a2 = 'surprise!';

$b = \""\\$\\{$a . 2}\"\";
