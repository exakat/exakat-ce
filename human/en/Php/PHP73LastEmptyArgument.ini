name = "PHP 7.3 Last Empty Argument";
description = "PHP allows the last element of any functioncall to be empty. The argument is then not send.

This was introduced in PHP 7.3, and is not backward compatible.

The last empty line is easier on the VCS, allowing clearer text diffs. 

<?php

function foo($a, $b) {
    print_r(func_get_args());
}


foo(1, 
    2, 
    );

foo(1);


?>
