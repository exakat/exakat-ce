name = "PHP 7.3 Last Empty Argument";
description = "PHP allows the last element of any functioncall to be empty. The argument is then not send.

This was introduced in PHP 7.3, and is not backward compatible.

<?php

function foo($a, $b) {
    print_r(func_get_args());
}


foo(1, 
    2, 
    );

foo(1);
