description = "Covariance is compatible return typehint. A child class may return an object of a child class of the return type of its parent's method.

Since a children class may return a children class of the return type, the evolution is in the same order.

Covariance is a PHP 7.4 feature. Covariance is distinct from argument contravariance.

<?php
class X {
  function m(Y $z): X {}
}

// m is overwriting the parent's method. 
// The return type is different.
// The return type is compatible, as Y is also a sub-class of X.
class Y extends X {
  function m(X $z): Y {}
}

?>
