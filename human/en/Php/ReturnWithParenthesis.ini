description = "return statement doesn't require parenthesis. PHP tolerates them with return statement, but it is recommended not to use them. 

From the PHP Manual : 'Note: Note that since return is a language construct and not a function, the parentheses surrounding its argument are not required and their use is discouraged.'.

<?php

function foo() {
    $a = rand(0, 10);

    // No need for parenthesis
    return $a;

    // Parenthesis are useless here
    return ($a);

    // Parenthesis are useful here: they are needed by the multplication.
    return ($a + 1) * 3;
}
