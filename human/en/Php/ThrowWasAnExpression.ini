name = "Throw Was An Expression";
description = "Throw used to be an expression. In PHP 7.0, there were some location where one couldn't use a throw : this was the case for arrow functions, which expect one expression as function's body. 

Using throw as an instruction makes the code incompatible with PHP 7 version and older. 

<?php

// Valid in PHP 8.0 and more recent
$fn = fn($a) => throw new Exception($a);

?>
