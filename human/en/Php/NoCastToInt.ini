description = "Do not cast floats values to int. Uses conversion functions like intval(), round(), floor() or ceil() to convert the value to integer, with known behavior. 

Use functions like floor(), round() or ceil() : they use an explicit method for rounding, that helps keeping the side effects under control.

    // echoes 7!
    echo (int) ( (0.1 + 0.7) * 10 );
