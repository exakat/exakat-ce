name = "Avoid Using stdClass";
description = "``stdClass`` is the default class for PHP. It is instantiated when PHP needs to return a object, but no class is specifically available.

It is recommended to avoid instantiating this class. Some PHP or frameworks functions, such as json_encode(), do return them : this is fine, although it is reported here.

If you need a ``stdClass`` object, it is faster to build it as an array, then cast it, than instantiate ``stdClass``. This is a micro-optimisation.";
code = "<?php

$json = '{\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"c\":3}';
$object = json_decode($json);
// $object is a stdClass, as returned by json_decode

// Fast building of $o
$a = [];
$a['a'] = 1;
$a['b'] = 2;
$a['c'] = 3;
json_encode( (object) $a);

// Slow building of $o
$o = new stdClass();
$o->a = 1;
$o->b = 2;
$o->c = 3;
json_encode($o);
