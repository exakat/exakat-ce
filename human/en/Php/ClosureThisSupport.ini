name = "Closure May Use $this";
description = "$this is automatically accessible to closures.

When closures were introduced in PHP, they couldn't use the $this variable, making is cumbersome to access local properties when the closure was created within an object. 

<?php

// Invalid code in PHP 5.4 and less
class Test
{
    public function testing()
    {
        return function() {
            var_dump($this);
        };
    }
}

$object = new Test;
$function = $object->testing();
$function();
    
?>

This is not the case anymore since PHP 5.4.
