description = "Assumptions in the code, that leads to possible bugs. 

Some conditions may be very weak, and lead to errors. For example, the code below checks that the variable `$a` is not null, then uses it as an array. There is no relationship between 'not null' and 'being an array', so this is an assumption. 

<?php

// Assumption : if $a is not null, then it is an array. This is not always the case. 
function foo($a) {
    if ($a !== null) {
        echo $a['name'];
    }
}

// Assumption : if $a is not null, then it is an array. Here, the typehint will ensure that it is the case. 
// Although, a more readable test is is_array()
function foo(?array $a) {
    if ($a !== null) {
        echo $a['name'];
    }
}

?>
