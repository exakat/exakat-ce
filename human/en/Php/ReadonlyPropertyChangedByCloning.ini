name = "Readonly Property Changed By Cloning";
description = "Readonly properties may be changed when cloning. This may happen in the ``__clone`` magic method. 

In that method, a new object is being created. It is acting like a constructor, and may tweak some of the values of the original object, before assigning them to the new object.

<?php

class x {
	public readonly int $p;
	
	function __construct($p) {
		$this->p = $p;
	}
	
	function __clone() {
		// This is possible in a clone, and only once
		$this->p = $this->p + 1;
		
		// This second call is not possible, as the property was set just above
		$this->p = $this->p + 2;
	}
}

$a = new x(1);
print_r(clone $a);

?>
