description = "foreach() loops use their own internal cursor.

A foreach loop won't change the internal pointer of the array, as it works on a copy of the source. Hence, applying array pointer's functions such as current() or next() to the source array won't have the same behavior in PHP 5 than PHP 7.

This only applies when a foreach() by reference is used.";
