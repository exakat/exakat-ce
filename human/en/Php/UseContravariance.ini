description = "Contravariance is compatible argument typehint. A child class may accept an object of a parent class of the argument type of its parent's method.

Since a children class may accept a parent class of the argynebt type, the evolution is in opposite order. 

Contravariance is a PHP 7.4 feature. Contravariance is distinct from return type covariance.

<?php
class X {
  function m(Y $z): X {}
}

// m is overwriting the parent's method. 
// The return type is different.
// The return type is compatible, as Y is also a sub-class of X.
class Y extends X {
  function m(X $z): Y {}
}

?>
