name = "Spread Operator For Array";
description = "The variadic operator may be used with arrays. This has been introduced in PHP 7.4. 

list() is not allowed to use this operator, as list() expected variables, not values.

<?php

$array = [1, 2, 3];
$extended_array = [...$array, 4, 5, 6];

// invalid syntax
[...$a] = [1,2,3];
