description = "The lettered logical operators ``and``, ``or`` and ``xor`` have lower precedence than assignation. It collects less information than expected.

When that precedence is taken into account, this is valid and useful code. Yet, as it is rare and surprising to many developers, it is recommended to avoid it.

It is recommended to use the &&, ^ and || operators, instead of and, or and xor, to prevent confusion.";
