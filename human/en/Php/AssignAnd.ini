explain="The usage of 'and' here is a workaround for PHP version that have no support for the coalesce. $autosubmit receives the value of $params['autosubmit'] only if the latter is set. Yet, with = having higher precedence over 'and', $autosubmit is mistaken with the existence of $params['autosubmit'] : its value is actually omitted."
