name = "Reflection Export() Is Deprecated";
description = "export() method in Reflection classes is now deprecated. It is obsolete since PHP 7.4 and will disappear in PHP 8.0.

The Reflector interface, which is implemented by all reflection classes, specifies two methods: __toString() and export(). 

<?php

ReflectionFunction::export('foo');
// same as
echo new ReflectionFunction('foo'), "\n";
 
$str = ReflectionFunction::export('foo', true);
// same as
$str = (string) new ReflectionFunction('foo');

?>
