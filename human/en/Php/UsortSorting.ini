name = "Usort Sorting In PHP 7.0";
description = "Usort(), uksort() and uasort() behavior has changed in PHP 7. Values that are equals (based on the user-provided method) may be sorted differently than in PHP 5. 

If this sorting is important, it is advised to add extra comparison in the user-function and avoid returning 0 (thus, depending on default implementation). 
In PHP 5, the results is : 

<?literal
Array
(
    [0] => 3
    [1] => 4
    [2] => 2
    [3] => 6
)
?>

in PHP 7, the result is : 

<?literal
Array
(
    [0] => 2
    [1] => 4
    [2] => 3
    [3] => 6
)
?>";
