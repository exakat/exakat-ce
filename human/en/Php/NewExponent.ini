name = "** For Exponent";
description = "The operator ``**`` calculates exponents, also known as power. 

Use it instead of the slower function pow(). This operator was introduced in PHP 5.6.
Be aware the the '-' operator has lower priority than the ** operator : this leads to the following confusing result.
This is due to the parser that processes separately ``-`` and the following number. Since ``**`` has priority, the power operation happens first.

Being an operator, ``**`` is faster than pow(). This is a microoptimisation.";
