name = "Php 8.0 Only TypeHints";
description = "Three scalar typehints are introduced in version 8.0. They are ``mixed``, ``false`` and ``null``. 

``false`` represents a false boolean, and nothing else. It is more restrictive than a boolean, which accepts true too. 
``null`` is an alternative syntax to ``?`` : it allows the type to be ``null``. 
``mixed`` is an special typehint which explicitly means any type.

An interface ``stringable`` was also introduced to identify objects that may be turned into a string. 

Both the above typehints are to be used in conjunction with other types : they can't be used alone.
In PHP 7.0, both those values could not be used as a class or interface name, to avoid confusion with the actual booleans, nor ``null`` value.";
