description = "Mark the safe PHP variables. 

PHP superglobals are usually filled with external data that should be filtered. However, some values may be considered safe, as they are under the control of the developer.

``$_GET``, ``$_POST``, ``$_FILES``, ``$_REQUEST``, ``$_COOKIES`` are all considered unsafe. Their level of validation is checked in other analysis. 

``$_SERVER`` is partially safe. It is valid for the following values : ``DOCUMENT_ROOT``, ``REQUEST_TIME``, ``REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT``, ``SCRIPT_NAME``, ``SERVER_ADMIN``, ``_``.";

// $_SERVER's PHP_SELF MUST be validated before usage
echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];

// $_GET MUST be validated before usage
