name = "Non-lowercase Keywords";
description = "The usual convention is to write PHP keywords (like ``as``, ``foreach``, ``switch``, ``case``, ``break``, etc.) all in lowercase. 



PHP understands them in lowercase, UPPERCASE or WilD Case, so there is nothing compulsory here. Although, it will look strange to many. 

Some keywords are missing from this analysis : ``extends``, ``implements``, ``as``. This is due to the internal engine, which doesn't keep track of them in its AST representation.";
