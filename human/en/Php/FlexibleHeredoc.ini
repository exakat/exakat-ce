description = "Flexible syntax for Heredoc. 

The new flexible syntax for heredoc and nowdoc enable the closing marker to be indented, and remove the new line requirement after the closing marker.

It was introduced in PHP 7.3.

<?php

// PHP 7.3 and newer
foo($a = <<<END
    
    flexible syntax
    with extra indentation
    
    END);
    
// All PHP versions
$a = <<<END
    
    Normal syntax
    
END;
    
    
?>

This syntax is backward incompatible : once adopted in the code, previous versions won't compile it.
