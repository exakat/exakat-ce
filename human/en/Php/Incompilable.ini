This is usually undesirable, as all code must compile before being executed. It may be that such files are not compilable because they are not yet ready for an upcoming PHP version.



Code that is not compilable with older PHP versions means that the code is breaking backward compatibility : good or bad is project decision.

When the code is used as a template for PHP code generation, for example at installation time, it is recommended to use a distinct file extension, so as to distinguish them from actual PHP code.";
