name = "Concat And Addition";
description = "Precedence between addition and concatenation has changed. In PHP 7.4, addition has precedence, and before, addition and concatenation had the same precedence.

From the RFC : ``Currently the precedence of '.', '+' and '-' operators are equal. Any combination of these operators are simply evaluated left-to-right``.

This is counter-intuitive though: you rarely want to add or subtract concatenated strings which in general are not numbers. However, given PHP's capability of seamlessly converting an integer to a string, concatenation of these values is desired.``

<?php
// Extracted from the RFC
echo "sum: " . $a + $b;
 
// current behavior: evaluated left-to-right
echo ("sum: " . $a) + $b;
 
// desired behavior: addition and subtraction have a higher precendence
echo "sum :" . ($a + $b);

?>

This analysis reports any addition and concatenation that are mixed, without parenthesis. Addition also means substraction here, aka using `+` or `-`.

The same applies to bitshift operations, ``<<`` and ``>>``. There is no RFC for this change.
