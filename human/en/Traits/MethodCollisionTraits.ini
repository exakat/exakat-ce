name = "Method Collision Traits";
description = "Two or more traits are included in the same class, and they have methods collisions. 

Those collisions should be solved with a ``use`` expression. When they are not, PHP stops execution with a fatal error : ``Trait method M has not been applied, because there are collisions with other trait methods on C``.

<?php

trait A {
    public function A() {}
    public function M() {}
}

trait B {
    public function B() {}
    public function M() {}
}

class C {
    use  A, B;
}

class D {
    use  A, B{
        B::M insteadof A;
    };
}

?>

The code above lints, but doesn't execute.
