name = "Useless Method Alias";
description = "It is not possible to declare an alias of a method with the same name. 

PHP reports that ``Trait method f has not been applied, because there are collisions with other trait methods on x``, which is a way to say that the alias will be in conflict with the method name. 

When the method is the only one bearing a name, and being imported, there is no need to alias it. When the method is imported in several traits, the keyword ``insteadof`` is available to solve the conflict.

<?php

trait t {
    function h() {}
}

class x {
    use t { 
        // This is possible
        t::f as g; 

        // This is not possible, as the alias is in conflict with itself
        // alias are case insensitive
        t::f as f; 
    }
}

?>
