name = "Useless Method Alias";
description = "It is not possible to declare an alias of a method with the same name. 

PHP reports that ``Trait method f has not been applied, because there are collisions with other trait methods on x``, which is a way to say that the alias will be in conflict with the method name. 

When the method is the only one bearing a name, and being imported, there is no need to alias it. When the method is imported in several traits, the keyword ``insteadof`` is available to solve the conflict.
