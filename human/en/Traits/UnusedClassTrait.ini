name = "Unused Trait In Class";
description = "A trait has been summoned in a class, but is not used. Traits may be used as a copy/paste of code, bringing a batch of methods and properties to a class. In the current case, the imported trait is never called. As such, it may be removed. 

Currently, the analysis covers only traits that are used in the class where they are imported. Also, the properties are not covered yet. 



There are some sneaky situations, where a trait falls into decay : for example, creating a method in the importing class, with the name of a trait class, will exclude the trait method, as the class method has priority. Other precedence rules may lead to the same effect.";
