For constructor, it is an implicit check. For other methods, the method has to be marked as ``CheckInjectableMethod`` to be checked. In case no attribute is provided, both for ``InjectableVersion`` and ``CheckInjectableVersion``, no error is returned.

The ``InjectableVersion`` allows to mark a specific class in a class hierarchy as the class to use in injections. 

The check applies to the whole method. 

The specifications include namespaces which are exempt from checking the attribute, namely test. This is not supported yet.";
