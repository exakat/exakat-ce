name = "Friend Attribute";
description = "A method or class can supply via a #[Friend] attribute a list of classes. Only these classes can call the method. This is loosely based on the C++ friend feature.

+ Multiple classes can be specified. E.g. #[Friend(Foo::class, Bar::class)]
+ A class can have a #[Friend] attribute, classes listed here are applied to every method.
+ The #[Friend] attribute is additive. If a class and a method have the #[Friend] the method can be called from any of the classes listed. E.g.
+ This is is currently limited to method calls (including __construct).

+ The Attribute is limited to the exact classes, the family hierarchy is not searched.
+ Multiple attributes can be specified to add more classes. E.g. #[Friend(Foo::class)] #[Friend(Bar::class)]

Based on the specificiations from Dave Liddament.";
