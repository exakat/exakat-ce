description = "When enabling PHP's stream SSL, it is important to use a safe protocol. 

All the SSL protocols (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), and TLS (1.0 are unsafe. The best is to use the most recent TLS, version 1.2. 

stream_socket_enable_crypto() and curl_setopt() are checked.

<?php

// This socket will use SSL v2, which 
$socket = 'sslv2://www.example.com';
$fp = fsockopen($socket, 80, $errno, $errstr, 30);

?>

Using the TLS transport protocol of PHP will choose the version by itself.
