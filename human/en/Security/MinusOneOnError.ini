name = "Minus One On Error";
description = "Some PHP native functions return -1 on error. They also return 1 in case of success, and 0 in case of failure. This leads to confusions.

In case the native function is used as a condition without explicit comparison, PHP type cast the return value to a boolean. In this case, -1 and 1 are both converted to true, and the condition applies. This means that an error situation is mistaken for a successful event. 
This analysis searches for if/then structures, ternary operators inside while() / do...while() loops.";
