name = "Can't Disable Function";
description = "This is the list of potentially dangerous PHP functions being used in the code, such as exec() or fsockopen(). 

eval() is not reported here, as it is not a PHP function, but a language construct : it can't be disabled.

<?php

// This script uses ftp_connect(), therefore, this function shouldn't be disabled. 
$ftp = ftp_connect($host, 21);

// This script doesn't use imap_open(), therefore, this function may be disabled. 

?>

This analysis is the base for suggesting values for the ``disable_functions`` directive.
