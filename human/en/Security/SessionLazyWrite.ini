The two extra methods are used to help lazy loading : the first actually checks if a sessionId is available, and the seconds updates the time of last usage of the session data in the session storage. 

This was spotted by ``Nicolas Grekas``, and fixed in Symfony `[HttpFoundation] Make sessions secure and lazy #24523 <https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/24523>`_.";

    //called to change the last time of usage for the session data.
    //It may be a file's touch or full write, or a simple update on the database
