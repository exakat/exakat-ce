name = "filter_input() As A Source";
description = "The filter_input() and filter_input_array() functions access directly to ``$_GET``. They represent a source for external data just like ``$_GET``, ``$_POST``, etc.

The main feature of filter_input() is that it is already filtered. The main drawback is that ``FILTER_FLAG_NONE`` is the ``none`` filter, and that default configuration is `FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW`.

The filter extension keeps access to the incoming data, even after the super globals, such as ``$_GET``, are unset.

<?php

// Removing $_GET
$_GET = [];

// with the default : FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW, this means XSS
echo filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'i');

// Same as above : 
echo filter_var(_GET, 'i');

?>
