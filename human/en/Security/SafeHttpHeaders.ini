description = "Avoid configuring HTTP headers with lax restriction from within PHP. 

There are a lot of HTTP headers those days, targeting various vulnerabilities. To ensure backward compatibility, those headers have a default mode that is lax and permissive. It is recommended to avoid using those from within the code.

<?php

//Good configuration, limiting access to origin
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.exakat.io');

//Configuration is present, but doesn't restrict anything : any external site is a potential source
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');

?>
