description = "The following cryptography algorithms are considered insecure, and should be replaced with new and more modern algorithms. 

``MD2``, ``MD4``, ``MD5``, ``SHA0``, ``SHA1``, ``CRC``, ``DES``, ``3DES``, ``RC2``, ``RC4``. 

When possible, avoid using them, may it be as PHP functions, or hashing function configurations (mcrypt, hash...).
Weak cryptography is commonly used for hashing values when caching them. In such cases, security is not a primary concern. However, it may later become such, when hackers get access to the cache folders, or if the cached identifier is published. As a preventive protection, it is recommended to always use a secure hashing function.";
