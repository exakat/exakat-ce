name = "Abstract Away";
description = "Avoid using PHP native functions that produce data directly in the code. For example, date() or random_int(). They should be abstracted away in a method, that will be replaced later for testing purposes, or even debugging.

To abstract such calls, place them in a method, and add an interface to this method. Then, create and use those objects.
This analysis targets two API for abstraction : time and random values. Time and date related functions may be replaced by `Carbon <https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/>`_, `Clock <https://github.com/lcobucci/clock>`_, `Chronos <https://github.com/cakephp/chronos>`_. Random values may be replaced with `RandomLib <https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib/>`_ or a custom interface.";
