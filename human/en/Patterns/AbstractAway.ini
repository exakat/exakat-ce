name = "Abstract Away";
description = "Avoid using PHP native functions that produce data directly in the code. For example, date() or random_int(). They should be abstracted away in a method, that will be replaced later for testing purposes, or even debugging.

To abstract such calls, place them in a method, and add an interface to this method. Then, create and use those objects.

<?php

// abstracted away date 
$today = new MyDate();
echo 'Date : '.$today->date('r');

// hard coded date of today : it changes all the time.
echo 'Date : '.date('r');

interface MyCalendar{
    function date($format) : string ;
}

class MyDate implements MyCalendar {
    function date($format) : string { return date('r'); }
}

// Valid implementation, reserved for testing purpose
// This prevents from waiting 4 years for a test.
class MyDateForTest implements MyCalendar {
    function date($format) : string { return date('r', strtotime('2016-02-29 12:00:00')); }
}

?>

This analysis targets two API for abstraction : time and random values. Time and date related functions may be replaced by `Carbon <https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/>`_, `Clock <https://github.com/lcobucci/clock>`_, `Chronos <https://github.com/cakephp/chronos>`_. Random values may be replaced with `RandomLib <https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib/>`_ or a custom interface.
