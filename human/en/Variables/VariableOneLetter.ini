name = "Variables With One Letter Names";
description = "Variables with one letter name are the shortest name for variables. They also bear very little meaning : what does contain the variable ``$w`` ? 

Some one-letter variables have meaning : ``$x`` and ``$y`` for coordinates, ``$i``, ``$j``, ``$k`` for blind variables. Others tend to be an easy way to give a name to a variable, without thinking too hard a good name.

<?php

// $a is reported as a one-letter variable
$a = 0;

// $i is considered a false positive. 
for($i = 0; $i < 10; ++$i) {
    $a += doSomething($i);
}

?>
