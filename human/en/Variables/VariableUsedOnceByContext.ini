Static and global variables are omitted here : they may be used multiple times by having the method being called multiple times. 

Blind variables, which are defined in a foreach() structure, are also omitted : the loop will use them multiple time, assigning different values each time.

Parameters that are inherited from parent classes' methods are also omitted : they are imposed by the structure, and cannot be avoided.";
