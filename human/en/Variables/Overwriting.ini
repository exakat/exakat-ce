description = "Replacing the content of a variable by something different is prone to errors. For example, it is not obvious if the $text variable is plain text or HTML text. 

<?php

// Confusing
$text = htmlentities($text);

// Better
$textHTML = htmlentities($text);

?>

Besides, it is possible that the source is needed later, for extra processing. 

Note that accumulators, like += .=  or [] etc., that are meant to collect lots of values with consistent type are OK.
