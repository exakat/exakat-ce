name = "Complex Dynamic Names";
description = "Avoid using expressions as names for variables or methods. 

There are no place for checks or flow control, leading to any rogue value to be used as is. Besides, the expression is often overlooked, and not expected there : this makes the code less readable.

It is recommended to build the name in a separate variable, apply the usual checks for existence and validity, and then use the name.

<?php

$a = new foo();

// Code is more readable
$name = strolower($string);
if (!property_exists($a, $name)) {
    throw new missingPropertyexception($name);
}
echo $a->$name;

// This is not check
echo $a->{strtolower($string)};

?>

This analysis only accept simple containers, such as variables, properties.
