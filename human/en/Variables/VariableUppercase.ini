name = "All Uppercase Variables";
description = "Usually, global variables are all in uppercase, so as to differentiate them easily. Though, this is not always the case, with examples like $argc, $argv or $http_response_header.

When using custom variables, try to use lowercase ``$variables``, ``$camelCase``, ``$sturdyCase`` or ``$snake_case``.

<?php

// PHP super global, also identified by the initial _
$localVariable = $_POST;

// PHP globals
$localVariable = $GLOBALS['HTTPS'];
