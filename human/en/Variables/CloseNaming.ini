description = "The following variables's name are very close and may lead to confusion.

Variables are 3 letters long (at least). Variables names build with an extra ``s`` are omitted.
Variables may be scattered across the code, or close to each other. 

Variables which differ only by case, or by punctuation or by numbers are reported here.
