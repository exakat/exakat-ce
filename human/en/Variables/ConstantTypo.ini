name = "Constant Typo Looks Like A Variable";
description = "A constant bears the same name as a variable. This might be a typo.

When the constant doesn't exist, PHP 8.0 yields a Fatal Error and stops execution. PHP 7.4 turns the undefined constant into its string equivalent. 

<?php

// Get an object or null
$object = foo(); 

// PHP 8.0 stops here, with a Fatal Error
// PHP 7.4 makes this a string, and the condition is always true
if (!empty(object)) {
    // In PHP 7.4, this is not protected by the condition, and may yield an error.
    $object->doSomething();
}

?>
