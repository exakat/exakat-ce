description = "A recycled variable is a variable used for two distinct missions in a method. There is usually a first part, with its own initialization, then, later in the method, a second part with a new initialization and a distinct usage of the variable. 

Recycled variables leads to confusion: with the new initialization, the variable changes its purpose. Yet, with the same name, and with a bit of lost context, it is easy to confuse it later. ";
