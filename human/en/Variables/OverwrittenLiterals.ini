name = "Overwritten Literals";
description = "The same variable is assigned a literal twice. It is possible that one of the assignation is too much.

This analysis doesn't take into account the distance between two assignations : it may report false positives when the variable is actually used for several purposes, and, as such, assigned twice with different values.

<?php

function foo() {
    // Two assignations in a short sequence : one is too many.
    $a = 1;
    $a = 2;
    
    for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
        $a += $i;
    }
    $b = $a;
    
    // New assignation. $a is now used as an array. 
    $a = array(0);
