name = "Non Ascii Variables";
description = "PHP allows certain characters in variable names. The variable name must only include letters, figures, underscores and ASCII characters from 128 to 255. 

In practice, letters outside the scope of ``a-zA-Z0-9`` are rare, and require more care when editing the code or passing it from OS to OS.
