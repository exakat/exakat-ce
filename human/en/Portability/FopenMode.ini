name = "Fopen Binary Mode";
description = "Use explicit ``b`` when opening files.

fopen() supports a ``b`` option in the second parameter, to make sure the read is binary. This is the recommended way when writing portable applications, between Linux and Windows.

<?php

// This opens file with binary reads on every OS
$fp = fopen('path/to/file.doc', 'wb');

// This may not open files with binary mode on Windows
$fp = fopen('path/to/file.doc', 'w');

?>

Also, Windows PHP does support a ``t`` option, that translates automatically line endings to the right value. As this is Windows only, this should be avoided for portability reasons.
