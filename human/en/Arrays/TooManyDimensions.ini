<?php

$a          = array();   // level 1;
$a[1]       = array();   // level 2
$a[1][2]    = array();   // level 3 : still valid by default
$a[1][2][3] = array();   // level 4 

?>

PHP has no nesting limit, and accepts any number of of dimensions. This is usually very memory hungry, and could be better replaced with classes.

The default threshold for this rule is 3 (see examples above).
