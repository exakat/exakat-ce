description = "Array index that looks weird. Arrays index may be string or integer, but some strings looks weird.

In particular, strings that include terminal white spaces, often leads to missed values.

<?php

$array = ['a ' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];

// Later in the code

//Notice: Undefined index: a in /Users/famille/Desktop/analyzeG3/test.php on line 8
echo $array['a'];

//Notice: Undefined index: b  in /Users/famille/Desktop/analyzeG3/test.php on line 10
// Note that the space is visible, but easy to miss
echo $array['b '];

// all fine here
echo $array['c'];

?>

Although this is rare error, and often easy to spot, it is also very hard to find when it strikes.
