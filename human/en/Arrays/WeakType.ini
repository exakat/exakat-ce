name = "Weak Type With Array";
description = "Using array as a type, to use specific index later.

The type of array is too weak : it allows to know that the array syntax has to be used in the function. Yet, it doesn't enforce the presence or absence of a specific index. 

<?php

function foo(array $variable) {
	echo $array['display'];
}

?>
