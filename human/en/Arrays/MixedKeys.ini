When defining default values in arrays, it is recommended to avoid mixing constants and literals, as PHP may mistake them and overwrite the previous with the latter.

Either switch to a newer version of PHP (5.5 or newer), or make sure the resulting array hold the expected data. If not, reorder the definitions.";
