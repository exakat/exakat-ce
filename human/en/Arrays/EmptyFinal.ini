name = "Empty Final Element";
description = "The array() construct allows for the empty last element. 

By putting an element on each line, and adding the final comma, it is possible to reduce the size of the diff when comparing code with the previous version.

<?php

// Array definition with final empty element
$array = [1,
          2,
          3,
          ];

// This array definition has only one line of diff with the previous array : the line with '4,'
$array = [1,
          2,
          3,
          4,
          ];

// This array definition is totally different from the first array : 
$array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

?>
