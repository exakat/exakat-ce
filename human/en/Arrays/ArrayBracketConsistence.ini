name = "Array() / [  ] Consistence";
description = "array() or [ ] is the favorite.

array() and [ ] have the same functional use. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that array() or [] are used depending on coding style and files. One file may be consistently using array(), while the others are all using []. 

<?php

$a = array(1, 2);
$b = array(array(3, 4), array(5, 6));
$c = array(array(array(7, 8), array(9, 10)), array(11, 12), array(13, 14)));

// be consistent
$d = [1, 3];
?>

The only drawback to use [] over array() is backward incompatibility.
