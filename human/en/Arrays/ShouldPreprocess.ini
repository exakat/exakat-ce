name = "Preprocess Arrays";
description = "Using long list of assignations for initializing arrays is significantly slower than the declaring them as an array. 

<?php

// Slow way
$a = []; // also with $a = array();
$a[1] = 2;
$a[2] = 3;
$a[3] = 5;
$a[4] = 7;
$a[5] = 11;

// Faster way
$a = [1 => 2, 
      2 => 3,
      3 => 5,
      4 => 7,
      5 => 11];

// Even faster way if indexing is implicit
$a = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];

?>

If the array has to be completed rather than created, it is also faster to use += when there are more than ten elements to add.

<?php

// Slow way
$a = []; // also with $a = array();
$a[1] = 2;
$a[2] = 3;
$a[3] = 5;
// some expressions to get $seven and $eleven
$a[4] = $seven;
$a[5] = $eleven;

// Faster way
$a = [1 => 2, 
      2 => 3,
      3 => 5];
// some expressions to get $seven and $eleven
$a += [4 => $seven, 
       5 => $eleven];

// Even faster way if indexing is implicit
$a = [2, 3, 5];
// some expressions to get $seven and $eleven
$a += [$seven, $eleven];
