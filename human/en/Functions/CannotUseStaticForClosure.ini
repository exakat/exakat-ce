Closures that makes use of the $this pseudo-variable cannot use the static keyword, at it prevents the import of the $this context in the closure. It will fail at execution.

Closures that makes use of the bindTo() method, to change the context of execution, also cannot use the static keyword. Even if $this is not used in the closure, the static keyword prevents the call to bindTo().";
