name = "Exit-like Methods";
description = "Those methods terminate the execution. 

They are detected when they do call exit() or die(). They may also be identified with the PHP 8.0 `#[NoReturn]` attribute, or the PHPDOC ``@noreturn`` (case insensitive).

If they are called, they will stop the application. They are a user-land equivalent of exit or die. 

<?php

// This function anytime the code has finished its processing.
function finish() {
    global $html;
    
    echo $html;
    die();
}

?>
