description = "Those methods terminate the execution. 

They are detected when they do call exit() or die(). They may also be identified with the PHP 8.0 ``#[NoReturn]`` attribute, or the PHPdoc ``@noreturn`` (case insensitive).

If they are called, they will stop the application. They are a user-land equivalent of exit() or die().
