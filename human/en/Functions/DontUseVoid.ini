description = "When a method returns void, there is no need to collect the result. The collected value is always ``null``.

With a ``void`` return type, the method is intented to be without return value. This analysis also include methods which are not returning anything, and could be completed with a ``void`` returntype. 

<?php

function foo() : void {
    // doSomething()
}

// This is useless
$result = foo(); 

// This is useless. It looks like this is a left over from code refactoring
echo foo();
