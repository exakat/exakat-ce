'callable' is a PHP keyword that represents callback functions. Those may be used in dynamic function call, like $function(); or as callback functions, like with array_map();

callable may be a string representing a function name or a static call (including ::), an array with two elements, (a class or object, and a method), or a closure.

When arguments are used to call a function, but are not marked with 'callable', they are reported by this analysis.";

explain = "$objMethod argument is used to call a function, a method or a localmethod. The typehint would save the middle condition, and make a better job than 'is_array' to check if $objMethod is callable. Yet, the final 'else' means that $objMethod is also the name of a method, and PHP won't validate this, unless there is a function with the same name. Here, callable is not an option. ";
