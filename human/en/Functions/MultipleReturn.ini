description = "Functions and methods that have multiple return statement. 

This makes it difficult to maintain : since the function may be short-circuited early, some later instruction may be omitted.

Ideally, guard clauses, which check if arguments are valid or not at the beginning of the method are the only exception to this rule.

<?php

function foo() {
    // This is a guard clause, that checks arguments. 
    if ($a < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    $b = 0;
    for($i = 0; $i < $a; $i++) {
        $b += bar($i);
    }
    
    return $b;
}
?>

Currently, the engine doesn't spot guard clauses.
