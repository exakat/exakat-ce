name = "Should Yield With Key";
description = "iterator_to_array() overwrite generated values with the same key. 

PHP generators are based on the ``yield`` keyword. They also delegate some generating to other methods, with ``yield from``. 

When delegating, ``yield from`` uses the keys that are generated with ``yield``, and otherwise, it uses auto-generated index, starting with 0. 

The trap is that each ``yield from`` reset the index generation and start again with 0. Coupled with iterator_to_array(), this means that the final generated array may lack some values, while a foreach() loop would yield all of them.
