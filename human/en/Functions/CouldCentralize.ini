description = "When a function is called across the code with the same arguments often enough, it should be turned into a local API. 

This approach is similar to turning literals into constants : it centralize the value, it helps refactoring by updating it. It also makes the code more readable. Moreover, it often highlight common grounds between remote code locations. 

The analysis looks for functions calls, and checks the arguments. When the calls occurs more than 4 times, it is reported. 

<?php

// str_replace is used to clean '&' from strings. 
// It should be upgraded to a central function
function foo($arg ) {
    $arg = str_replace('&', '', $arg);
    // do something with $arg
}

class y {
    function bar($database ) {
        $value = $database->queryName();
        $value = str_replace('&', '', $value);
        // $value = removeAmpersand($value);
        // do something with $arg2
    }
}

// helper function
function removeAmpersand($string) {
    return str_replace('&', '', $string);
}

?>
