This approach is similar to turning literals into constants : it centralize the value, it helps refactoring by updating it. It also makes the code more readable. Moreover, it often highlight common grounds between remote code locations. 

The analysis looks for functions calls, and checks the arguments. When the calls occurs more than 4 times, it is reported.";
