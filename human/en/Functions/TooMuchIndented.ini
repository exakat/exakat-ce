name = "Too Much Indented";
description = "Reports methods that are using more than one level of indentation on average. 

Indentations levels are counted for each for, foreach, if...then, while, do..while, try..catch..finally structure met. Compulsory expressions, such as conditions, are not counted in the total. Levels of indentation start at 0 (no indentation needed)

This analysis targets methods which are build around large conditions : the actual useful code is nested inside the branches of the if/then/else (for example). 

The default threshold ``indentationAverage`` of 1 is a good start for spotting large methods with big conditional code, and will leave smaller methods, even when they only contain one if/then. Larger methods shall be refactored in smaller size. 

The parameter ``minimumSize`` set aside methods which are too small for refactoring.

<?php

// average 0
function foo0() {
    $a = rand(1,2);
    $a *= 3;
    
    return $a;
}

// average 0.66 = (0 + 1 + 1) / 3
function foo0_66() {
    // if () is at level 0
    if ($a == 2) { // condition is not counted
        $a = 1;    // level 1
    } else {
        $a = 2;    // level 1
    }
}

// average 1 = (0 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4
function foo1() {
    // if () is at level 0
    if ($a == 2) {
        // if () is at level 1
        if ($a == 2) {
            $a = 1; // level 2
        }
        $a = 1; // level 1
    } else {
        $a = 2; // level 1
    }
}
