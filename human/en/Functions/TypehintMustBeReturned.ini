name = "Type Must Be Returned";
description = "When using a type for a method, it is compulsory to use a at least one return in the method's body. This is true for nullable type too : ``return`` alone won't be sufficient.

When the method contains a return expression, PHP doesn't lint unless the return expression has a value. Any value will do, and it will actually checked at execution time.

When the method contains no return expression, PHP only checks it at execution time. 

There is no need for a return expression when the method throws an expression, yield values, triggers an error or triggers an assertion. Even in case of inheritance or implementation, the return type may be replaced by ``never``.";

// The function should at least, return a value
function foo() : Bar { }

// The function should at least, return a value : Null or an object. Void, here, is not acceptable.
