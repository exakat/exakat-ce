name = "Typehint Must Be Returned";
description = "When using a typehint for a method, it is compulsory to use a at least one return in the method's body. This is true for nullable typehint too : ``return`` alone won't be sufficient.

When the method contains a return expression, PHP will not lint unless the return expression has a value. Any value will do, and it will actually checked at execution time.

When the method contains no return expression, PHP will only check this at execution time. 

There is no need for a return expression when the method throws an expression, triggers an error or triggers an assertion. Even in case of inheritance or implementation, the return type may be replaced by `never`. 

<?php

// The function returns a value (here, correct object)
function foo() : Bar { return new Bar(); }

// The function should at least, return a value
function foo() : Bar { }

// The function should at least, return a value : Null or an object. Void, here, is not acceptable.
function foo() : ?Bar { return; }

?>
