description = "This analysis checks that a call to a method uses the types.

This analysis is compatible with Union types and with Intersection types.

<?php

function foo(string $a) {

}

// wrong type used
foo(1);

// wrong type used
foo(\"1\");

?>

Currently, this analysis doesn't take into account ``strict_types = 1``. As such, ``int`` and ``string`` won't be compatible.
