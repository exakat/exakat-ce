description = "A parameter is cancelled, when its value is hardcoded, and cannot be changed by the calling expression. The argument is in the signature, but it is later hardcoded to a literal value : thus, it is not usable, from the caller point of view.

Reference argument are omitted in this rule, as their value changes, however hardcoded, may have an impact on the calling code.
