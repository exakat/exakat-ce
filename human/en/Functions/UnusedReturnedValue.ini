description = "The function called returns a value, which is ignored. 

Usually, this is a sign of dead code, or a missed check on the results of the functioncall. At times, it may be a valid call if the function has voluntarily no return value. 

It is recommended to add a check on the return value, or remove the call. 



Note that this analysis ignores functions that return void (same meaning that PHP 7.1 : return ; or no return in the function body).";
