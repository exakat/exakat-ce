name = "Unused Returned Value";
description = "The function called returns a value, which is ignored. 

Usually, this is a sign of dead code, or a missed check on the results of the functioncall. At times, it may be a valid call if the function has voluntarily no return value. 

It is recommended to add a check on the return value, or remove the call. 

<?php

// simplest form
function foo() {
    return 1;
}

foo();

// In case of multiple return, any one that returns something means that return value is meaningful
function bar() {
    if (rand(0, 1)) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return ;
    }
}

bar();

?>

Note that this analysis ignores functions that return void (same meaning that PHP 7.1 : return ; or no return in the function body).
