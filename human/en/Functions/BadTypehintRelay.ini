name = "Bad Typehint Relay";
description = "A bad typehint relay happens where a type hinted argument is relayed to a parameter with another typehint. This will lead to a Fatal error, and stop the code. This is possibly a piece of dead code.

<?php

// the $i argument is relayed to bar, which is expecting a string. 
function foo(int $i) : string {
    return bar($i);
}

// the return value for the bar function is not compatible with the one from foo;
function bar(string $s) : int {
    return (int) $string + 1;
}

?>

It is recommended to harmonize the typehints, so the two methods are compatible.
