name = "Parameter Hiding";
description = "When a parameter is set to another variable, and never used.

While this is a legit syntax, parameter hiding tends to make the code confusing. The parameter itself seems to be unused, while some extra variable appears.

Keep this code simple by removing the hiding parameter.

<?php

function substract($a, $b) {
    // $b is given to $c;
    $c = $b; 

    $c is used, but $b would be the same
    return $a - $c;
}

?>
