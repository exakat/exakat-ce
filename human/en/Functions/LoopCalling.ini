When those functions have no other interaction, the code is useless and should be dropped.

    return $a;
}

// if foo1 nor foo2 are called, then this is dead code. 
// if foo1 or foo2 are called, this recursive call should be investigated.

Loops of size 2, 3 and 4 function are supported by this analyzer.
