name = "Multiple Identical Closure";
description = "Several closures are defined with the same code. 

It may be interesting to check if a named function could be defined from them.

<?php

// the first squares, with closure
$squares= array_map(function ($a) {return $a * $a; }, range(0, 10) );

// later, in another file...
// another identical closure 
$squaring = function ($x) { return $x * $x; };
foo($x, $squaring);

?>

This analysis also reports functions and methods that look like the closures : they may be considered for switch.
