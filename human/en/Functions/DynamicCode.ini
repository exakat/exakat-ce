name = "Function With Dynamic Code";
description = "Mark a method, function, closure, arrow function that includes dynamic code. 

Dynamic code is based on usage of include() and co, extract() and eval(). 

<?php

// Function with dynamic code
function foo($x) {
    include $x;
    return $y;
}

// Static coe Function
function foo($x) {
    return $y + $x;
}

?>

This is a support rule, to help omits some special cases in other rules.
