name = "Function Called With Other Case Than Defined";
description = "Functions and methods are defined with a specific case. Often, this is done on purpose,
either to distinguish the method from others, such as PHP natives functions, or to follow a naming
convention. 

PHP functions are case insensitive, which leads to situations like : 

<?php
  function myUtility($arg) { 
    /* some code here */
  } 

   myutility($var);
?>

It is recommended to use the same casing in the function call and the function definition.
