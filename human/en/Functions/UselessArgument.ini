name = "Useless Argument";
description = "The argument is always used with the same value. This value could be hard coded in the method, and save one argument slot.

There is no indication that this argument will be used with other values. It may be a development artifact, that survived without cleaning.

<?php

// All foo2 arguments are used with different values
function foo2($a, $b) {}
foo2(1, 2);
foo2(2, 2);
foo2(3, 3);

// The second argument of foo is always used with 2
function foo($a, $b) {}
foo(1, 2);
foo(2, 2);
foo(3, 2);

?>

Methods with less than 3 calls are not considered here, to avoid reporting methods used once. Also, arguments with a default value are omitted. 

The chances of useless arguments decrease with the number of usage. The parameter `maxUsageCount` prevents highly called methods (more than the parameter value) to be processed.
