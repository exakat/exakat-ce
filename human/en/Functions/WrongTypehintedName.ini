name = "Wrong Typehinted Name";
description = "The parameter name doesn't reflect the typehint used.

There are no restriction on parameter names, except its uniqueness in the signature. Yet, using a scalar typehint as the name for another typehinted value is just misleading. 

<?php

function foo(string $array,
             int $int) {
    // doSomething()
}

function bar(array $strings) {
    // doSomething()
}

?>

This analysis relies on exact names : calling an array a list of ``strings`` is OK with this analysis.

This analysis relies on a few variations of names : ``bool`` and ``boolean``, ``int`` and ``integer``.
