name = "Could Type With Iterable";
description = "Suggest using ``iterable`` typehint for arguments.

``iterable`` represents both ``array`` and objects that implements ``Iterator`` interface. Both types are coerced, and usable here. 

<?php

// $s may be both an array or an iterator
function foo($s) : int {
    $t = 0;
    foreach($s as $v) {
        $t += (int) $v;
    }
    
    return $t;
}

?>
