name = "Uses Default Values";
description = "Default values are provided to methods so as to make it convenient to use. However, with new versions, those values may change. For example, in PHP 5.4, htmlentities() switched from ``Latin1`` to ``UTF-8`` default encoding.

<?php

$string = Eu não sou o pão;

echo htmlentities($string);

// PHP 5.3 : Eu n&Atilde;&pound;o sou o p&Atilde;&pound;o
// PHP 5.4 : Eu n&atilde;o sou o p&atilde;o

// Stable across versions
echo htmlentities($string, 'UTF8');

?>

As much as possible, it is recommended to use explicit values in those methods, so as to prevent from being surprise at a future PHP evolution. 

This analyzer tend to report a lot of false positives, including usage of count(). Count() indeed has a second argument for recursive counts, and a default value. This may be ignored safely.";
