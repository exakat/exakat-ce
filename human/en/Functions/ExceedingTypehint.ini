<?php

interface i {
    function i1();
    function i2();
}

interface j {
    function j1();
    function j2();
}

function foo(i $a, j $b) {
    // the i typehint is totally used
    $a->i1();
    $a->i2();
    
    // the i typehint is not totally used : j2() is not used.
    $b->j1();
}

?>

Tight typehint prevents the argument from doing too much. They also require more maintenance : creation of dedicated interfaces, method management to keep all typehint tight.
