    // When argument are omited, the default value is not the same as the next method

explain="generer_url_entite() takes $connect in, with a default value of empty string. Later, generer_url_entite() receives that value, but uses null as a default value. This forces the ternary test on $connect, to turn it into a null before shipping it to the next function, and having it processed accordingly."
