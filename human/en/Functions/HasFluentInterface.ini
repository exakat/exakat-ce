name = "Method Has Fluent Interface";
description = "Mark a method when it only returns $this.

Fluent interfaces allows for chaining methods calls. This implies that $this is always returned, so that the next method call is done on the same object.

<?php

$object = new foo();
$object->this()
       ->is()
       ->a()
       ->fluent()
       ->interface();
       
class foo {
    function this() {
        // doSomething
        return $this;
    }

    function is() {
        // doSomethingElse
        return $this;
    }
    
    /// Etc. for a(), fluent(), interface()...
}

?>
