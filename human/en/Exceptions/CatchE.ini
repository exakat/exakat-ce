name = "Caught Variable";
description = "Catch clauses require an exception and a variable name. Often, the variable name is the same, `$e`, as learnt from the manual.

There seems to be a choice that is not enforced : one form is dominant, (> 90%) while the others are rare. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of the three : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

<?php

try {
    // do Something()
}
catch (MyException1 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException2 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException3 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException4 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException5 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException6 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException7 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException8 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException9 $e)       { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (MyException10 $e)      { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (\RuntimeException $e)  { $log->log($e->getMessage();}
catch (\Error $error)         { $log->log($error->getMessage();}
catch (\Exception $exception) { $log->log($exception->getMessage();}
