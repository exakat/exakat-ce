<?php

class b { 
    public $b = 'c';
    function __toString() { return __CLASS__; }
}
$x = array(1 => new B());

// -> after the $x[1] looks like a 2nd dereferencing, but it is not. 
print "$x[1]->b";

print "{$x[1]->b}";
// displays : c

?>

It is advised to add curly brackets around those structures to make them non-ambiguous.
