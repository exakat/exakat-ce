name = "Should Typecast";
description = "When typecasting, it is better to use the casting operator, such as ``(int)`` or ``(bool)``.

Functions such as intval() or settype() are always slower.

<?php

// Fast version
$int = (int) $X;

// Slow version
$int = intval($X);

// Convert to base 8 : can't use (int) for that
$int = intval($X, 8);


?>

This is a micro-optimisation, although such conversion may be use multiple time, leading to a larger performance increase.  

Note that intval() may also be used to convert an integer to another base.
