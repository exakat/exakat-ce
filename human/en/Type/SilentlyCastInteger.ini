name = "Silently Cast Integer";
description = "Those are integer literals that are cast to a float when running PHP. They are too big for the current PHP version, and PHP resorts to cast them into a float, which has a much larger capacity but a lower precision.

Compare your literals to ``PHP_MAX_INT`` (typically ``9223372036854775807``) and ``PHP_MIN_INT`` (typically ``-9223372036854775808``).
This applies to binary (``0b10101``...), octal (``0123123``...) and hexadecimal (``0xfffff``...) too.
