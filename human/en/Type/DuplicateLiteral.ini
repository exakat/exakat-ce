name = "Duplicate Literal";
description = "Report literals that are repeated across the code. The minimum replication is 5, and is configurable with ``maxDuplicate``.

Repeated literals should be considered a prime candidate for constants.

Integer, reals and strings are considered here. Boolean, Null and Arrays are omitted. 0, 1, 2, 10 and the empty string are all omitted, as too common. This list of omitted constants may be configured with the ignoreList parameter : a comma separated list of values.

<?php
    // array index are omitted
    $x[3] = 'b';

    // constanst are omitted
    const X = 11;
    define('Y', 'string')

    // 0, 1, 2, 10 are omitted
    $x = 0; 
    
?>
