description = "List of all protocols that were found in the code.

From the manual : PHP comes with many built-in wrappers for various URL-style protocols for use with the filesystem functions such as fopen(), copy(), file_exists() and filesize(). 

<?php
// Example from the PHP manual, with the glob:// wrapper

// Loop over all *.php files in ext/spl/examples/ directory
// and print the filename and its size
$it = new DirectoryIterator("glob://ext/spl/examples/*.php");
foreach($it as $f) {
    printf("%s: %.1FK\n", $f->getFilename(), $f->getSize()/1024);
}
?>
