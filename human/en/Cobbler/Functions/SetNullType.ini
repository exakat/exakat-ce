name = "Set Null Type";
description = "Adds a Null type to typehints when necessary. 

This cobbler only adds a null type when there is already another type. It doesn't add a null type when no type is set. 

It works on methods, functions, closures and arrow functions. It doesn't work on properties.

The null type is added as a question mark `?` when the type is unique, and as null when the types are multiple.
