name = "Set Typehints";
description = "Automagically add scalar typehints to methods and properties. Arguments and return values are both supported. 

When multiple possible types are identified, no typehint is added. If a typehint is already set, no typehint is added.

Magic methods, such as __get(), __set(), __construct(), __desctruct(), etc are not modified by this cobbler. 

Methods which have parent's methods (resp. children's) are skipped for argument typing (resp return typing) : this may introduce a incompatible definition. On the other hand, methods which have children's methods (resp. parents') are modified for argument typing (resp return typing), thanks to covariance (resp. contravariance). 

Void (as a scalar type) and Null types are processed in a separate cobbler. 

By default, and in case of conflict, array is chosen over iterable and int is chosen over float. There are parameter to alter this behavior.
