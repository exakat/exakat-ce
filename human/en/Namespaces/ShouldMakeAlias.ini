description = "Long names should be aliased.

Aliased names are easy to read at the beginning of the script; they may be changed at one point, and update the whole code at the same time. 
Finally, short names makes the rest of the code readable. 

<?php

namespace x\y\z;

use a\b\c\d\e\f\g as Object;

// long name, difficult to read, prone to change.
new a\b\c\d\e\f\g();

// long name, difficult to read, prone to silent dead code if namespace change.
if ($o instanceof a\b\c\d\e\f\g) {
    
}

// short names Easy to update all at once.
new Object();
if ($o instanceof Object) {
    
}
