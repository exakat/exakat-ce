name = "Possible Alias Confusion";
description = "An alias is used for a class that doesn't belong to the current namespace, while there is such a class. This also applies to traits and interfaces.

When no alias is used, PHP will search for a class in the local space. Since classes, traits and interfaces are usually stored one per file, it is a valid syntax to create an alias, even if this alias name is the name of a class in the same namespace. 

Yet, with an alias referring to a remote class, while a local one is available, it is possible to generate confusion.";
