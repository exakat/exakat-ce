description = "It is possible to make an alias of a class and call it with this new name. It either rely on the `use` expression, preferable at the beginning of the namespace, or the class_alias() function, for dynamic and application-wide aliases. 

`use` expressions are valid only in one file, while class_alias() impacts the whole application, once it is called. class_alias() may also be used with dynamic elements, such as variabless.
