description = "To clone an object is the creation of a new distinct object, from an existing one. This is basically a copy, although the object itself is multiplied by call the clone operator.

By default PHP does a shallow clone, duplicating the scalars (string, integer...) and keeping the same reference to objects. To make a deep clone, the class must define the ``__clone`` magic method.

Cloning is similar to creating another object of the same class, without requiring all the constructor arguments.
