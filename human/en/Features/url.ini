description = "Universal Resource Locator is a string that represents a resource, where to find it, how to access it. 

The full URL include the following information : 

+ protocol : for example, http, https, mongodb, zip
+ user : the username for authentication purposes
+ pass : the password associated with the username
+ server : the name or the address of the server where the resource reside
+ path : the location of the resource on the server
+ query : extra parameters to reach the resource
+ fragment : the location of the resource inside the previous address (server + path)

PHP has several functions dedicated to processing URL, such as parse_url() and http_build_query(). 

PHP also makes use of URL as a generalisation for file path. For example, file_get_contents() and fopen() both work on local and remote files, via URL.

PHP is able to process different protocols with its internal Protocols and Wrappers, using the file system functions.
