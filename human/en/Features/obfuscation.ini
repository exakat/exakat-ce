description = "Obfuscation refers to the practice of deliberately making something difficult to understand or obscure. In the context of web security, code obfuscation is a technique used to make source code more difficult to filter and identify as a threat. The primary goal is not to improve the program's functionality but rather to hinder reverse engineering, the extraction of sensitive information from the code."
