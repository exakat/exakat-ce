description = "DNF stands for 'Disjunctive Normal Form'. It is a standard form used in propositional logic and Boolean algebra. DNF represents logical expressions as a disjunction (OR) of one or more conjunctions (AND) of literals. In simpler terms, it is a way to express logical statements using only the logical operators \"OR\" and \"AND\".

The DNF form allows for the representation of any logical expression using a combination of OR and AND operators. It is particularly useful in logic analysis, theorem proving, and boolean circuit design.
