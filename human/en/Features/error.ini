description = "The `Error` class is a base class for all internal PHP error exceptions. It represents an error that occurs during the execution of PHP code. The Error class extends the built-in Throwable interface, making it possible to catch and handle these error exceptions using try-catch blocks.

The Error class has several child classes that represent specific types of errors. Some common child classes include:

+ ParseError: Represents a syntax error that occurs during parsing of PHP code.
+ TypeError: Represents a type-related error, such as passing an incorrect argument type to a function or method.
+ DivisionByZeroError: Represents an error that occurs when dividing a number by zero.
+ OutOfMemoryError: Represents an error that occurs when the PHP process runs out of memory.

Here's an example that demonstrates catching and handling a ParseError:

php


In this example, the eval() function is used to evaluate a string of PHP code. However, the code contains a syntax error with a missing semicolon. This results in a ParseError being thrown. We use a try-catch block to catch the ParseError exception, and then display the error message using the getMessage() method.

It's important to note that these error exceptions are only thrown for internal PHP errors. User-generated errors (e.g., triggered using the trigger_error() function) are not instances of the Error class. Instead, they are represented by the ErrorException class, which extends Exception."
code = "<?php

try {
    eval('echo ""Hello, World!""'); // Missing semicolon generates a ParseError
} catch (ParseError $e) {
    echo 'Caught ParseError: ' . $e->getMessage();
}
