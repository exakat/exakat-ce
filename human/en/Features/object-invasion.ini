description = "PHP allows objects of one class to access private structures of an object of the same class.

This is useful when cloning or importing objects with __set_state() : within the same class, those methods can create new objects and assign all their properties.

This feature break OOP encapsulation : even when using private visibility, it is possible to access then from outside the object.

	function __set_state($array) {
