description = "When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are <?php and ?> which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them. 

The classic PHP tag is ``<?php``, and it also has a short version, for better serving xml tags : `<?`. This one relies on the ``short_open_tag`` directive.

Previously, PHP supported also Javascript-style and ASP-style tags, though these are now unsupported.
