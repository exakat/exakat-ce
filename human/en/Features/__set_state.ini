description = "__set_state() is a magic method : it is called when an object has been exported with var_export(), and has to be instantiated again. 

__set_state() is tasked with recreating the object, assigning the previous values to it, and recreating any missing properties, such as database connections or resources.

The __set_state() method has no counterpart : var_export() do not use any magic method. 

__set_state() is a static method, unlike the other magic methods.
