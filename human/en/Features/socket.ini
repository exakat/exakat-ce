description = "A socket refers to a communication endpoint that allows two processes on a network to exchange data. Sockets provide a mechanism for processes on different devices to communicate with each other, whether they are on the same machine or across the Internet.

PHP provides a set of functions for working with sockets, allowing developers to create both client and server applications that can communicate over networks using various protocols, including TCP and UDP."
