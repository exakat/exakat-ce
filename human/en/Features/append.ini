description = "Append is an array operation, which adds an element at the end of the array. It is also called a push.

There are two operators for this feature ; the ``[]`` operator, which has to be placed after a variable or member. There is also the array_push() function, which is available as a callback, unlike the operator.

The opposite operation is a pop, with the function array_pop(). Array_unshift() is the append at the beginning of the array.
