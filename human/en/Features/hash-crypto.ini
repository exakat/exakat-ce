description = "A cryptographic hash is an algorithm which maps a string to a fixed sized string, with a method that is difficult or impossible to revert.

Some famous algorithms : MD5, SHA1, SHA256, HAVAL, Bcrypt.

Other algorithms include crc32(), though it is not considered a cryptography. 

While the extension 'hash' only process hashes, there are other extensions which offer these features : openssl, sodium and password hashing. Mhash and mcrypt are older PHP extensions, which are now discontinued.
