description = "Overflow happens when a value goes beyond a limit : out of its range of existence, the behavior of the value is now unknown.

Overflow happens with integers (limited to PHP_INT_MAX  and PHP_INT_MIN), floats (PHP_FLOAT_MAX and PHP_FLOAT_MIN). 

Other situations, such as accessing an array element or a string character beyond its last element, defaults to returning `null`.
