description = "Dereferencing is the action to access a value, which is referenced with a pointer. Since PHP has no pointer, dereferencing applies to accessing an element in an array or an object. 

Dereferencing is also possible to function and methods calls : when a function returns an array or an object, it is possible to immediately access one of the element by using the array or method syntax.
