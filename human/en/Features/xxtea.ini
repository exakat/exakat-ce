description = "XXTEA is a symmetric encryption algorithm that stands for 'Corrected Block TEA' (TEA refers to Tiny Encryption Algorithm). It is primarily used for encrypting and decrypting data, providing a level of security for sensitive information.

XXTEA operates on 32-bit integer data blocks and employs a 128-bit key. It uses a series of iterations and bitwise operations to scramble the data and make it unreadable without the corresponding decryption process. XXTEA is a block cipher with a fixed block size of 8 bytes.";
