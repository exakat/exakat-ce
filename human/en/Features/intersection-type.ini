description = "Intersection types, also called intersectional types, is a specification syntax where several types act together as a single typehint. The individual types are separated with the & operator. 

The value typed with an intersection type must satisfy all the types at the same time. 

Intersection types don't work with scalar values, which are excluding one another. It works with polymorphism, where one object may be of several types at the same time, when implementing interfaces.
