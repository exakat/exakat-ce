description = "Variables that reside in the global scope, and may be imported with the global keyword.

To become a global variable, a variable may use one of the following ways : 

+ Be declared as such with the `global` keyword
+ Be created in the `$GLOBALS` variable, which is a global variable itself
+ Be created outside any function, method, closure
+ Be a super-global

Global variables provides a way to share data in different and remote scopes. It also provide a way for data to be modified by another part of the code, without warning.
