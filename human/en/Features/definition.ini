description = "A definition is the description of a particular constant, function, method, property, class, trait, interface or enum. 

A variable also has a definition, also called an initialisation: variables have no formal definition. They use an unconditional assignation to do so.

The definition is also called a declaration. The declaration must happen before usage. 

Definitions happens in custom code, in libraries or in PHP extensions. 

There are functions dedicated to listing defined elements: ``get_declared_constants()``, ``get_declared_traits()``, ``get_declared_interfaces()``, ``get_declared_classes()``, ``get_class_vars()`` and ``get_class_methods()``.
