description = "The scope is the context in which a variable is defined. A variable scope is usually its host method, or the file in which is used. It also extends to any included files, and skips other method definition.  

Arrow functions are initialised with the same scope than the defining scope, but do not write back in it. Closure with the use keyword also import variables from the defining scope. 

Scopes are generally considered as global or local.
