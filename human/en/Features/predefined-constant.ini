description = "Predefined constants are PHP native constants, available at the start of the PHP engine. 

Those constants are for internal usage, such as E_ALL, for error reporting, or STDOUT, for output. Some constants are providing information, such as PHP_VERSION's PHP version number. Others are meant to give a readable name to common values or arguments, such as DATE_RFC822. 

Other constants come from extensions : for example, the Math extension defines M_PI for the pi constant (3.14159...), libsodium defines SODIUM_CRYPTO_CORE_RISTRETTO255_SCALARBYTES, etc. Those are also predefined constants, although they depend on the compilation of PHP.
