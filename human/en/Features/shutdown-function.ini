description = "The shutdown function is a PHP custom function which is called when the application is shutting down. This is after a call to exit(), die() or the natural end of life of the script.

Multiple functions may be registered with the register_shutdown_function() function. They will be called in order of registration.

Shutdown function acts as destructors : they should clean up any unfinished jobs, and gracefully free resources, such as closing files with their correct endings, or gracefully closing connections.
