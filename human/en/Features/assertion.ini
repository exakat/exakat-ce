description = "Assertions are checks that take effect in development and testing environments, but are optimised away to have zero cost in production. 

Assertions are disabled in production, by using the `zend.assertions` directive. Then, they are said 'zero-cost' : they are completely removed from the code, and not executed.

Assertions are a development tool, and should not be used. Be aware that the removal of the assertion may leave the system running with unchecked data. 

There are user-land assertions, such as `webmozart/assert <https://packagist.org/packages/webmozart/assert>`_ and `beberlei/assert <https://packagist.org/packages/beberlei/assert>`_.
