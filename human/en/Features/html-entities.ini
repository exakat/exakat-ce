description = "HTML entities are a way to write special characters. For example, the superior and inferior characters have a special meaning in HTML. To be able to display them correctly, it is recommended to use the following writing : ``&gt;``  and ``&lt;``.

This protection is extended to many characters. They have a numerical entity, such as ``&38;`` and a literal entity, such as ``&amp;``, for the ampersand. 

Such entities are typical of HTML. They are different in different languages. 

PHP uses htmlentities() and html_entities_decode() to convert those characters from and to their entities.

HTML entities are useful in the HTML code, but they are confusing in a text file, which has no special entity.
