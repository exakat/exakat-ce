description = "Integers can be specified in octal (base 8) notation. Octal integer syntax starts with ``0o`` (zero-o) and only contains digits from 0 to 7.

Initially, octal integers were formatted by simply starting with a initial 0. This features is still available, yet should be replaced with the less confusing syntax with ``0o``.
