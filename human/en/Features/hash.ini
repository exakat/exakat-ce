+ PHP extension
+ PHP function
+ a general computer science concept, that transforms data into another value
+ a general computer science concept, that turns a string into another fixed-sized string, in a way that is difficult to revert
+ a synonym for arrays with arbitrary keys, also known as map or associative array

Hash allows direct or incremental processing of arbitrary length messages using a variety of hashing algorithms. 

While the extension 'hash' only process hashes, there are other extensions which offer these features : openssl, sodium and password hashing. Mhash and mcrypt are older PHP extensions, which are now discontinued.
