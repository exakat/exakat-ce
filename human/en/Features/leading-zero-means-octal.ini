description = "PHP integer syntax has some special formats for binary, octal and hexadecimal formats. In particular, an integer starting with 0 is in octal format. This leads to easy confusion, as the leading 0 is considered neutral.

In PHP 8.0, a new notation with an 0 was introduced : it makes the octal format just as explicit as the binary or the hexadecimal one. 

Octals are mainly used with the mkdir() function, and special math domains.
