description = "A micro-optimisation is a piece of code that performs better than another, yet brings only a small gain of speed.

Micro-optimisation should be done only for highly constraints systems, or application that deliver a high number of hits in short times : usually, it takes one to ten millions usage for the gain to be visible. 

Yet, micro-optimisations may be valuable on the long run, or as a good practice. 

It is often a pointless to discuss the micro-optimisation. It is a do or don't, and should raise a consensus, or left alone.
