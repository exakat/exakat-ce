When the same name is used both in GET and POST method, the priority is defined by the `variable_order` directive. 

The received values are all strings or arrays. They are strings by default, and other scalar types needs a casting. The values are arrays when the URL uses the `[]` format. 

$_REQUEST is a superglobal : it is always available, in every scope.
