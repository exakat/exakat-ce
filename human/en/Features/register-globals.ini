description = "Register globals is an old and removed feature of PHP, which automatically created variables from the incoming super globals, such as $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_COOKIES. 

This meant that the initial set of variables in an application was not known, as they would depend on the incoming data. 

Register-globals has been removed in PHP 5.4.
