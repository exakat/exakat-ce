description = "Recursion in PHP is a method or a function, which calls itself. 

While the method calls itself, it also must have branch and not call itself : otherwise, the call will never end.

Functions, methods, closures and arrowfunctions may be recursive.

Recursion is an abstract notion : it is also used in the PHP name itself. PHP : Hypertext Preprocessor.
