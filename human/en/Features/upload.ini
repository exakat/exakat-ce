description = "PHP is able to receive files as part of a form submission. 

PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867 compliant browser. 

File upload code is based on the $_FILES superglobale, and move_uploaded_file() function. It also relies on several PHP directives :  ``file_uploads``, ``upload_max_filesize``, ``upload_tmp_dir``, ``post_max_size`` and ``max_input_time``.

if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile)) {
    echo 'File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.';
} else {
    echo 'Possible file upload attack!';
