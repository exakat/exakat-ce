+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['name']`` : the original name of the file on the client machine.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['type']`` : the mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be "image/gif". This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['size']`` : the size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']`` : the temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['error']`` : the error code associated with this file upload.
+ ``$_FILES['userfile']['full_path']`` : the full path as submitted by the browser. This value does not always contain a real directory structure, and cannot be trusted. Available as of PHP 8.1.0.
