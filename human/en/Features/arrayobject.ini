description = "``ArrayObject`` is a native class that provides the functionality of an array with the added features of an object. It extends the base ``ArrayObject`` class and implements the ``ArrayAccess``, ``Countable``, ``IteratorAggregate``, and ``Serializable`` interfaces.

With ``ArrayObject``, it is possible to create objects that have the behavior of arrays, meaning it is possible to access array elements as properties and use object-oriented methods to manipulate the array. 

Operator such as append ``[]``, or foreach() loops are then available with those objects.
