description = "Encoding is the way characters are organized to hold a meaning while being transmitted, stored or manipulated. 

Encoding applies to PHP scripts, which should be UTF-8 encoded, although it might support other formats.

Encoding applies to incoming and outgoing data.

Encoding operations are provided with ``ext/mbstring``, ``ext/iconv`` and ``ext/intl`` extensions. 

Encoding is also used for code : the source is encoded when it is transformed in an unreadable yet still executable form.
