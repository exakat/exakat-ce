description = "A special type that represents any available type. It is equivalent to not explicitely setting the type, though it is now explictly done. 

A ``mixed`` type may be also represented by a union of all possible types. 

``mixed`` is useful when literally any type should be supported, such as with a cache system. Yet, it is usually recommended to consider reducing the number of possible types by using a common interface or a union type.
