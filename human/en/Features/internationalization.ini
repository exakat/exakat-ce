description = "Internationalization is the process to make the human interface of a program in a local language. 

PHP includes some internationalization capabilities, via the locale, for dates or money format, or with the ext/intl extension. 

Most of the interface translations for application is done with specific components, such as `Symfony/translation`. Translation of interface messages is part of this concept.

Internationalization is also called `i18n`, aka i, 18 letters and n. This is shorter to write. This word may be written with a z or an s, depending on the flavor of English being used.
