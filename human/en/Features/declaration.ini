description = "A declaration is a statement that defines a structure, such as a function, a class, method, property, etc. A declaration must occur before the usage of the declared resource.

PHP requires a declaration for some structures, and allows its omission for others. For example, a class must be declared before usage, while a variable can be used without declaration. Properties are currently being moved to a compulsory declaration.

		$this->undeclaredProperty = 1;
		
		// $b is undefined. It creates a warning, but the code keeps executing.
