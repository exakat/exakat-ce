description = "__set() is a magic method : it is called when a property cannot be access, either because it doesn't exist, or because its visibility prevents it. It is used to give a value to the property.

That way, it is possible to create dynamically properties, without hardcoding them. 

The __set() method is usually paired with the __get() method.
