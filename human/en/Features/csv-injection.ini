description = "A CSV injection is a vulnerability, where a csv file triggers the execution of a formula, stored in a cell. Formulas in cells starts usually with `=`, and may also use `+`, `-`, `@`, tabulation and carriage return.

Depending on the opening spreadsheet software, various targets may be achieved, ranging from sending local data to a remote server, to take over the computer. 

CSV injections rarely target PHP itself, as it is not a spreadsheet, nor support formulas in CSV files. Also, components such as `PHPspreadsheet` are able to run a wide range of formulas. 

PHP may relay an injection by saving it in a CSV file.
