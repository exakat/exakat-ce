description = "Constants which hold information about the current location of the code.

Those constants are magic, because they have a constant syntax, yet their value may change, even during the execution of the code. 

+ __LINE__	The current line number of the file.
+ __FILE__	The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned.
+ __DIR__	The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to dirname(__FILE__). This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.
+ __FUNCTION__	The function name, or {closure} for anonymous functions.
+ __CLASS__	The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar). When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.
+ __TRAIT__	The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar).
+ __METHOD__	The class method name.
+ __NAMESPACE__ The name of the current namespace.

Those constants are case insensitive. All those syntax will work : `__METHOD__`, `__method__`, `__method__`.
