description = "Views in a SQL server is a virtual table, build as the result of a SQL query.

Instead of accessing a concrete table, a view is built as a SELECT query, and display the result of that query. As a SELECT, it may join with multiple tables, display columns, build dynamic values, and drop others.

SQL views are usally non-writable (no UPDATE, no INSERT), as they do not mirror a real table.
