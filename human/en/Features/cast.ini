description = "Cast operators change the type of the variable to the desired type. Conversion between the current format and the target format may happen. 

The available casts are:

(int), (integer) - cast to integer
(bool), (boolean) - cast to boolean
(float), (double), (real) - cast to float
(string) - cast to string
(array) - cast to array
(object) - cast to object
(unset) - cast to NULL (Deprecated since PHP 7.2)

There is no operator to convert to a specific class type.
