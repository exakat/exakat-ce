description = "Inclusion, often represented by the ``include`` keyword, is the process to read an external file, and evaluate with the current application for execution. It may define new structures, and execute code. 

Inclusion relies on four language structures : include, require, include_once, require_once. 

Inclusion is often hidden in autoload() functions : the code is included class per class, upon request.
