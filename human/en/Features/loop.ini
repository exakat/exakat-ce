description = "A loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing arrays or collections of data. PHP provides several types of loops, including: for, while, do...while and foreach.

The most popular loop is foreach().

Loops may hide in certain functions : for example, array_map() and array_walk() apply a method to every element in an array. 

Generators are closely related to the foreach() loop.
