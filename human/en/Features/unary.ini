description = "A unary operator is an operator that operates on a single operand. It performs an operation on the value of the operand. PHP supports several unary operators, including the following:

+ Post increment operator ``$a++``
+ Pre increment operator ``++$a``
+ Post decrement operator ``$a--``
+ Pre decrement operator ``--$a``
+ Negation operator ``-$a``
+ Logical Not operator ``!$a``
+ Bitwise Not operator ``~$a``

The four first operators change the underlying value and also return the value. The three last operators only return the changed value, leaving the original value unchanged.
"
code = "<?php

$a = 10;
print -$a;  // -10, $a unchanged
print $a;   // 10
print ++$a; // 10, $a changed
print $a;   // 11
