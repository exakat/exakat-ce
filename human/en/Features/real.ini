description = "Real numbers are represented using the ``float`` data type. 

They are also commonly referred to as ``floating-point numbers`` or ``double-precision numbers``. Floats are used to represent decimal numbers, including both whole numbers and fractions, with a certain degree of precision. Real numbers are used for performing mathematical calculations that require decimal accuracy.

There used to be ``real`` dedicated structures in PHP (like is_real() or (real)), though, they were removed in PHP 7.0. In case of doubt, refer to ``float``. 

It's important to be aware of potential rounding errors or precision issues when working with real numbers (floats) in PHP or any other programming language that uses floating-point representation. If you require exact decimal precision, you might need to use specialized libraries or techniques to handle arbitrary precision arithmetic.
