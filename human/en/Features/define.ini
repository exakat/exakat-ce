description = "define() is a PHP function, that introduces constant definitions. 

define() is a function, and may be called anywhere. It is slower than `const`, as it is only executed at runtime. define() doesn't allow class constants creation.

define() used to create case-insensitive constant, but this was abandoned in PHP 7.3.
