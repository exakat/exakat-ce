description = "Return typehints are the types used for the return values of a method or function. 

They are the same as the argument types, with a few addition : 

+ `void`, which means that no value is returned. (No usage of return, or return with no explicit value)
+ `never`, which means that the function won't return : either it will kill the application, or it will throw an exception.

Return types are ignored when the method throws an exception. 

return typehint are covariant : they get more or equally precise with each new child generation.
