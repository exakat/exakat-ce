description = "PHP allows any number of arguments to be passed to a functioncall. In the function definition, receiving those arguments means managing an arbitrary number of parameters. 

This is achieved with the variadic operator, or with functions such as func_get_args().

They are also called variable argument lists.

When the arguments are dynamic, aka they are collected at execution time, the operator variadic or the function call_user_func_array() turns an array to arguments.

    print \"This function is called with \".count($func_get_args()).\" arguments\\n\";
