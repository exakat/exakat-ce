description = "Initialisation is the process to unconditionally give a value to a variable, or any container, before its usage. 

Initialisation has a dedicated syntax for properties, parameters and static variables. There is no dedicated syntax for variable initialisation: they are created when needed, with a default value of NULL. They also emits a warning in that case.

Initialisation ensures that a variable is hold a sane value before any usage. This makes it important for security purposes too.
