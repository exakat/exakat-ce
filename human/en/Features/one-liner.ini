description = "A one-liner refers to a concise and often single expression that accomplishes a specific task. It's a shorthand way of expressing functionality in a compact form. 

One liner are supposed to fit on one line. The line is also supposed to be limited in size. 

One liners tends to pack a lot of operations in one expression. When used aggressively, one liners become less readable, and more complex. 

Some commands have a short and a long syntax, such as ``if-then-else`` and the ternary operator ``? : ``.
