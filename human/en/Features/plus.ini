description = "+ is a native PHP operator, which may have three meaning : 

+ The addition, as in mathematics. This works on integers and double.
+ The merging of arrays. This merging will set the keys once, then omit the next values.
+ The + sign in front of a number, to make it explicitely positive. This is optional, and may be repeated.
