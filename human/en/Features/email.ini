description = "Email, short for electronic mail, is a method of exchanging digital messages between people using electronic devices. These messages can contain text, attachments, images, and other multimedia elements. Email is a widely used communication tool for both personal and professional purposes.

PHP can send emails with the ``mail()`` function. PHP doesn't receive emails, as it requires a server, so it relies on the ``imap`` extension. 

PHP also offers special filter to validate email addresses, with the filter extension.
