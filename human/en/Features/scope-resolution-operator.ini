description = "The Scope Resolution Operator is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

Traditionally, this used to be a feature of the function get_class(). The operator is more modern and faster. 

This operator is often called double-colon, or ``paamayim-nekudotayim`` : this is double-colon in Hebrew."
