description = "Unreachable code refers to a section of code within a program that can never be executed during the program's runtime. It means that the code is written in such a way that it can never be reached or accessed by the program's execution flow.

Unreachable code can occur due to several reasons:

+ Conditional statements
+ Early return statements
+ Infinite loops
+ Branching with goto, yield, break, return, die...
