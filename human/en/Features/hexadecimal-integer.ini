description = "Hexadecimal integers are integers with an hexadecimal representation. Their value is the same, yet their are written in a different way than the common decimal. 

Hexadecimal has native support in PHP with the ``0x123`` format. There is also support for hexadecimal characters, inside double-quote strings, with the ``\\xhh`` syntax.

There are functions to convert from and to hexadecimal format : hexdec(), dechex() and base_convert(), from ten to sixteen.

PHP also has special syntax for binary and octal numbers.
