description = "Spaceship operator is an operator which reports if a value is larger, equal or smaller than another value. It return 1, 0 or -1 in each case, respectively. 

The spaceship operator may be replace by a `-` (minus) sign, if the compared values are correct. It may also be replace with `!=`, since -1 and 1 are both cast to `true`. 

The spaceship operator got its name from its resemblance to an flying saucer. Battleship operator, or death star operator do not exist.
