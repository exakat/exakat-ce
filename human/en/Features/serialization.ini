description = "Serialization is a string representation of an object, that can be stored as text, and then turned into the original object again.

The reverse process is unserialization. 

In PHP, there are different ways to implement serialization. The native way is to rely on the serialize() and unserialize(), which, in turn, rely on the __serialize() and __unserialize() magic method. Then, var_export() and require() make another serialization method. WDDX, XML, JSON or YAML all work as serialization, yet they usually are not considered, over speed or performance issues.
