description = "The term \"global space\" refers to the global namespace \"\\\" or the top-level scope in the PHP language. The global space is where global variables, functions, and constants reside. When you define a variable, function, or constant without specifying a namespace, it belongs to the global space.

It is recommended to avoid using the global space for any definition: they should be stored in a custom namespace.
