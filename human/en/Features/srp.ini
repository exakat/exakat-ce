description = "Single Responsability Principle is a coding principle where one component is responsible for one task, and nothing more. 

It particularly aims at avoid multiple responsabilities in code, where several tasks are performed at the same time. This means that any modifications to that method has an impact on each of the tasks, leading to potential spillovers. 

Single Responsability Principile relies on the possibility to identify one responsability per component, and exclude any other.
