description = "A type error refers to an error that occurs when there is a mismatch or violation of data types. It typically happens when a function or operation is performed on a value of an incompatible type. PHP is a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types can change during runtime. However, certain operations and functions expect specific types, and if the actual type doesn't match the expected type, a type error may occur.

In other situations, PHP applies some type juggling, and automatically convert the type to a suitable type. This is often the case to preserve backward compatibility, when a transparent operation make sense.

// PHP convert the integer 12 to the string '12', to allow the concatenation to proceed.
