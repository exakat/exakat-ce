description = "PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control structures; namely, ``if``, ``while``, ``for``, ``foreach``, and ``switch``. In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to change the opening brace to a colon (:) and the closing brace to ``endif;``, ``endwhile;``, ``endfor;``, ``endforeach;``, or ``endswitch;``, respectively."
