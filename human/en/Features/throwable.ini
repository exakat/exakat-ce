description = "Throwable is a PHP native interface, which is required for any object to be used with thrown, such as `Exception` and `Error`.

This interface may be used with catch clauses, to catch everything that is thrown. Yet, this interface cannot be implemented directly. It should be acquired by extending `Exception`.
