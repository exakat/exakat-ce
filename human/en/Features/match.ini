description = "The ``match`` expression is the remote cousin of the ``switch``. It takes a value, branch among a list of cases, or fallback to a default one, and returns a unique value. 

``match`` use a strict comparison for the comparison. ``match`` raise an error if no case match, unless the ``default`` case is provided. 

``match`` is an expression, to be used in an assignment, while ``switch`` is a command, and must be used alone.
