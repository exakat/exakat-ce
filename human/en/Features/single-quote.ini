description = "Single quoted strings are strings that include a literal value. 

This is an simpler version of the double-quoted strings. 

It is possible to include variables `$var`, single-dimension arrays `$array[1]` or `$array[index]`, and single-dereferencing object members `$object->member`. More complex expressions require usage of curly braces `{$}`, or the usage of the dot operator.

Double quoted strings use the anti-slash `\\` to escape special characters, such as the anti-slash and the `$` sign.
