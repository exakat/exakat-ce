description = "Class properties are variables, local to the class.

They might have visibility, chosen among : public (default), protected and private.

They might have a default value. By default it is null.

They might have a typehint, since PHP 7.4

They might be readonly, for properties which are only set once, and cannot be modified. 

They might be static, and not related to an object, but to a class. 

Property should be uniquely defined in a class. They may be redefined in children or parent when the visibility allows it.
