description = "CSV is Concurent Version System. It is a revision control system. 
It is a version control system that allows multiple users to collaborate on a project by managing the changes made to files and keeping track of different versions of those files. CVS was one of the earlier popular version control systems, introduced in the 1980s.

With CVS, developers can check out a copy of a project's source code, make changes to files, and then commit those changes back to the repository. It provides features like branching and merging, which allow parallel development and the integration of changes from different branches."
