description = "A command bus is a design pattern used in software development, particularly in the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). It helps to decouple the sender of a command from its handler, allowing for better separation of concerns and improving the overall architecture of the application.

A command bus works together with commands and command handlers. 

Here's a simplified overview of how a command bus works:

+ The sender (e.g., a controller in a web application) creates a command object and sends it to the command bus.
+ The command bus examines the command object and identifies the appropriate command handler based on the type of the command.
+ The command bus dispatches the command to the identified command handler.
+ The command handler processes the command and performs the required actions (e.g., modifying the database, updating the domain model, etc.).
