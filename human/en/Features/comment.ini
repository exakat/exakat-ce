description = "In PHP, comments are used to add explanatory notes or annotations within your code. Comments are not executed by the PHP interpreter; they are purely for documentation purposes, and they help you and others understand the code better. PHP supports two main types of comments:

Single-line comments: These are comments that span only one line. They are typically used for brief explanations or annotations within the code. Single-line comments in PHP can be created using either double slashes (``//``) or a hash symbol (``#``).

Multi-line comments: These are comments that can span multiple lines, allowing for more extensive explanations or commenting out large sections of code. Multi-line comments in PHP are enclosed within ``/*`` and ``*/``.

It's important to note that comments do not affect the execution of the PHP code; they are ignored by the PHP interpreter: in fact, they are removed before execution. Comments are primarily for developers and maintainers of the code to understand its purpose, logic, or any special considerations. Well-documented code with meaningful comments can make it easier for you and others to read, understand, and maintain PHP applications.

Comments may be formalized with a specific syntax, and create automated instruction for other application. For example, phpdoc comments are providing extra information with a specific syntax.
