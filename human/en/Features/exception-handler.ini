description = "The exception handler is a default or custom function, which is called once an exception has exhausted all available try-catch blocks.

The execution stops once the handler has been called : as such, it is possible to log or display information related to debugging. 

The exception handler is different from the try/catch block : the latter allows the execution to carry on, when the exception is processed.
