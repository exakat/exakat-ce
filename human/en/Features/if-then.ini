description = "A if-then-else command branches the execution based on an condition. When the condition is true, the first branch, called ``then`` is executed. When the condition is false, the second branch, called ``else``, is executed. 

If-then structures may be chained with the `elseif` keyword. The else branch is then a new if-then structure, with a second condition.
