description = "Halts the execution of the compiler. This can be useful to embed data in PHP scripts, like the installation files. 

Byte position of the data start can be determined by the ``__COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET__`` constant which is defined only if there is a __halt_compiler() presented in the file. 

Note : this is the documentation from PHP.net.
