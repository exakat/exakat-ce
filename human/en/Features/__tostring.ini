description = "__tostring() is a magic method : it is called when the object has to be converted into a string.

That way, it is possible to dynamically convert the object to a string and display it, or transmit it to another part of the application. 

__toString() is called when ``strict_types`` is not active. Otherwise, passing an object to a string parameter yields an error: it requires an explicit type cast.

__toString() is always called in concatenation, and string interpolation.

There is no magic method to convert an object to another type.
