description = "__tostring() is a magic method : it is called when the object has to be turned into a string.

That way, it is possible to dynamically convert the object to a string and display it, or transmit it to another part of the application. 

__toString() is called when strict_type is not active. Otherwise, passing an object to a string parameter yields an error.

__toString() is always called in concatenation, and string interpolation.
