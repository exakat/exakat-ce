description = "Accessibility is the process to make the code accessible to everyone. 

PHP code being text, its accessibility relies on the IDE. The main accessible feature is the usage of tabulations, instead of multiple spaces.

Accessibility is also called `a11y`, aka a, 11 letters and y. This is shorter to write.
