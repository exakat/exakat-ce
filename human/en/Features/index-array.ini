PHP index may be integers or strings only. Other data types generate an error or a type conversion. For example, floats are turned into integer. integer-shaped strings will also be turned into integer.

PHP index start at 0. They may be automatically assigned by appending a new value with the `[]` operator : then, they use the greatest available index + 1.
