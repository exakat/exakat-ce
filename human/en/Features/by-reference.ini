description = "When calling a method, or returning from it, data may be passed by value or by reference. 

By reference, a reference to the the data is passed : any modification on that value inside the method will be reflected in the original value. 

This is the alternative way of passing data to methods : the default way is to use by value, which copies the data. 

Passing by reference is the default behavior with object. Otherwise, it needs to be declared with the ``&`` operator, in the function signature.

Returned value are passed back to the calling context with the same rule than for parameters.
