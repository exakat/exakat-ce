description = "An ``UnhandledMatchError`` error is thrown when the subject passed to a match expression is not handled by any case of the match expression. This means that all the cases have been exhausted, and then, the ``default`` case is missing. 

Instead of finishing the ``match`` expression without any returned value, it throws an exception and stops the execution. This is a different behavior than ``switch``, which will continue the processing, even if nothing was found, potentially leading to unexpected situations."
