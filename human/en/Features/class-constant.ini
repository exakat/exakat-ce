description = "Static constants are constants that are defined inside a class, interface, trait (since PHP 8.2) and enumeration. 

Static constants have a visibility. Visibility may be ``public``, ``protected``, ``private``. By default, and for backward compatibility, a constant without a visibility is ``public``.

Static constants may also be overwritten by children classes. They can also use the ``final`` keyword, to avoid such behavior.

Static constants are defined at coding time, and cannot be changed later, not dynamically created. 

Static constant syntax is the same than for enumeration cases.
