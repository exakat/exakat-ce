description = "Whitespace refers to spaces, tabs, and newline characters: those characters are invisible on a white background, hence the name. 

Whitespace is used to format and organize the code, making it more readable. 

However, in PHP, whitespace is generally not significant in terms of parsing; the PHP interpreter usually ignores whitespace. There are some rare situations where the whitespaces have a role : in heredoc syntax, and for formatting floats.

Whitespace is not a notion specific to PHP : other languages have them too. For example, trim() removes whitespace at the beginning and the end of a string value."
