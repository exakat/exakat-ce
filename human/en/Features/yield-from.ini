description = "The `yield from` keyword is used to delegate the iteration control of one generator to another. It was introduced in PHP 7.0 as part of the generator delegation feature. 

This keyword allows to create more maintainable and modular code by reusing the code logic of one generator within another.

Generator delegation works with another generators, Traversable objects, and arrays."
