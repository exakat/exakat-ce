description = "Session hijacking, also known as session stealing, is an attack where an unauthorized person takes over a user's session. In the context of web applications, this typically involves gaining control of a user's session in order to impersonate them and perform actions on their behalf.

There are several ways to realize session hijacking : session fixation, man in the middle attack, session ID stealing and XSS.

Session hijacking is mitigated by having a way to identify if a user is the actual owner of a session, or it was stolen, and is being used by someone else. For example, a secondary cookie, the IP address or the browser signature are generally stable. Someone providing a session ID, with a new browser signature should trigger a new identity validation.
