description = "An alias type is a short name for several types at once. Under the hood, alias types are union type. 

PHP offers several native alias types, such as ``iterable``, which represents ``array | Traversable``. Alias type are not available for customisation. 

The same rules applies to alias types than other types : for example, ``array | iterable`` produces a 'Duplicate type array is redundant' error.
