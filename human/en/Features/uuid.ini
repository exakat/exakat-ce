description = "UUID is a Universally Unique IDentifier. It is an identifier that anyone can generate, and that has a near certainty that it identify something unique, in the universe. 

UUID are in contrast to classic integer ids, such as auto-increment primary keys, which usually start at 0, and are incrementally generated. Not only this means connecting to a database, and querying the right table, but also means that there are multiple usage of 1, in each of these tables.

UUID are a standard. The standard has versions from 1 to 5, each with improvements.
