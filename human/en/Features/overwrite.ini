description = "Overwriting is the process to replace a method, property or constant that was defined in a parent, by a local definition. This is related to OOP programming and inheritance.

Overwriting is applicable to constants, methods and properties. Methods still should have a compatible signature with their parent's equivalent, while properties and constants may change their (default) value.

Overwriting is prevented by the ``final`` keyword, or the ``private`` visibility.

Overwriting is also called overloading.
