description = "PHP uses special tags to identify code that has to be executed. The short tags are a special set of PHP tag, shorter than the usual ``<?php``. It was simply ``<?``.

Short tags may be disabled in PHP configuration, with the ``short_open_tag`` directive. 

Short tags are different from echo tags : those tags immediately display data.

From the manual : As short tags can be disabled it is recommended to only use the normal tags (<?php ?> and <?= ?>) to maximise compatibility.
