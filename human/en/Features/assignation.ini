description = "Assignation refers to the process of assigning a value to a variable. It is a fundamental concept in programming that allows to store and manipulate data.

The main operator of assignation is `=`. There are secondary operators, such as `+=`, `*=`, ``??=``, ... which are called short assignation : they apply a specific operation while assigning.

Finally, there are some inherent assignations: foreach() loops, method calls and list() operator performs assignations without an explicit operator."
