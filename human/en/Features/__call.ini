description = "__call() is a magic method : it is called when a method cannot be accessed, either because it doesn't exist, or because its visibility prevents it.

That way, it is possible to create dynamically methods, without hardcoding them. 

The __call() method receives the name of the target-method, and a list of argument, as an array. 

The __call() method has a related version for static methods, called ``__callStatic``."
