description = "Clone makes a duplicate of an object.

PHP makes a shallow clone : it will only make a copy of the scalars properties, and it will keep the reference to any object untouched. This means that objects are shared between an object and its clone. 

To perform a deep clone, aka to clone an object and its referenced properties, there is the magic method __clone().
