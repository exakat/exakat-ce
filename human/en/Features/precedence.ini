description = "Precedence organizes the way operators are executed, when they are mixed in the same expression.

For example, `1 + 2 * 3` will produce `7`, since `*` has a higher precedence than `+`. 

Every operator has a precedence, and when they have the same precedence, the rightmost one yield to the leftmost one.

Precedence offers some reading surprises to human readers. For example, `! $b instanceof \\X` really applies `instanceof` first, and `&&` has a higher priority than `and`, even though they perform the same function.
