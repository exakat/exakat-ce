description = "The DOM extension in PHP is an extension that allows developers to work with XML documents using the Document Object Model (DOM) API. It provides a set of classes and functions to parse, manipulate, and generate XML documents.

The DOM extension provides a tree-based representation of an XML document, where each element, attribute, and text node is represented as an object. This allows developers to traverse and manipulate the XML document easily.
