PHP supports several wrappers natively, in particular ``file://``, ``http://``, ``ftp://``, ``php://``, ``zlib://``, ``data://``, ``glob://``, ``phar://``, ``ssh2://``, ``rar://``, ``ogg://`` and ``expect://``.

Customs wrappers may be registered with stream_wrapper_register(). A wrapper may write in any kind of format.
