description = "Inclusion is the operation to add PHP code stored in an external file, into another PHP code. 

Inclusions rely on four native functions: ``include``, ``require``, ``include_once``, ``require_once``. 

Inclusions have application with templates, configurations, caches, function libraries. 

Inclusions have been superseded by autoload in recent PHP versions. Autoload relies on inclusion, though."
