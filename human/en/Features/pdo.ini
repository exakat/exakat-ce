description = "PHP Data Objects (PDO) is an interface that abstract access to databases. The same interface may be used to access different databases. 

PDO may access 10 different databases : 
+ CUBRID
+ MS SQL Server
+ Firebird
+ IBM
+ Informix
+ MySQL
+ MS SQL Server
+ Oracle
+ ODBC and DB2
+ PostgreSQL
+ SQLite 2 and 3

The different access relies on drivers and DSN to connect to a database. The DSN describes the server to reach, and the driver handles the communication protocol.
