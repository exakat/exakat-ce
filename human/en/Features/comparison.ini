description = "Comparison operators, as their name implies, allow you to compare two values. 

PHP comparisons exists with type-juggling, `==`, `<>`, `<=>`, switch() and `!=`, and with type checks, match(), `===` and `!==`. 

Inequalities only exist with type-juggling. 

There are also functions dedicated to comparisons, with specific applications : strcmp(), strcasecmp(), strnatcasecpm(), strcoll(), similar_text(), levensthein(), bccomp(), version_compare(), hash_equals().
