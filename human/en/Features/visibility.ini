description = "Properties, methods and classes may have a visibility. It limits the scope of the definition :

+ private : to the current class
+ protected : to the current class hierarchy (parents and children classes)
+ public : to all the code

In PHP, the default visibility is public. 

Visibility may no change, unless when overwriting it with a trait, or in a child class.
