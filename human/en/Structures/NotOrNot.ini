name = "Not Or Tilde";
description = "There are two NOT operator in PHP : ``!`` and ``~``. The first is a logical operator, and returns a boolean. The second is a bit-wise operator, and flips each bit. 

Although they are distinct operations, there are situations where they provide the same results. In particular, when processing booleans. 

Yet, ``!`` and ``~`` are not the same. ``~`` has a higher priority, and will not yield to ``instanceof``, while ``!`` does.

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

<?php

// be consistent
if (!$condition) {
    doSomething();
}

if (~$condition) {
    doSomething();
}

?>
