description = "It is possible to use the result of a methodcall directly as an array, without storing the result in a temporary variable.

This works, given that the method actually returns an array. 

This syntax was not possible until PHP 5.4. Until then, it was compulsory to store the result in a variable first. Although this is now superfluous, it has been a standard syntax in PHP, and is still being used.
Storing the result in a variable is still useful if the result is actually used more than once.";
