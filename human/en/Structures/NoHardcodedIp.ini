This may also come handy when testing.

 * List of trusted proxy servers

 * You may set this to an array containing a combination of
 * - IPv4 addresses, e.g. `192.168.2.123`
 * - IPv4 ranges in CIDR notation, e.g. `192.168.2.0/24`
 * - IPv6 addresses, e.g. `fd9e:21a7:a92c:2323::1`
 *
 * _(CIDR notation for IPv6 is currently work in progress and thus not
 * available as of yet)_
 *
 * When an incoming request's `REMOTE_ADDR` matches any of the IP addresses
 * specified here, it is assumed to be a proxy instead of a client. Thus, the
 * client IP will be read from the HTTP header specified in
 * `forwarded_for_headers` instead of from `REMOTE_ADDR`.
 *
 * So if you configure `trusted_proxies`, also consider setting
 * `forwarded_for_headers` which otherwise defaults to `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`
 * (the `X-Forwarded-For` header).
 *
 * Defaults to an empty array.
