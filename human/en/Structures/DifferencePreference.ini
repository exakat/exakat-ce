name = "Difference Consistence";
description = "There are two operators to check a difference : <> and !=.

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that != and <> are used depending on coding style and files. One file may be consistently using <>, while the others are all using !=. 

<?php

// Both != and <> are used in the code
// When one of them is used less than 10%, it is reported as a consistence issue.
if ($a != $b) {

} elseif ($c <> $d) {

}

?>

<> and != are the two only comparison operators that are identical.
