name = "Could Use Match";
description = "The switch() syntax use may be replaced by a match() call. 

The simplest case for such refactoring is when each of the switch's case (including default), assign one value to the same variable. See this below : 

<?php
    switch($a) {
        case 1: 
            $b = '1';
            break;
        case 2: 
            $b = '3';
            break;
        default:  
            $b = '0';
            break; 
    }
    
    /*
    $b = match($a) {
        1 => '1',
        2 => '3',
        default => '0'
    };
    */
?>

Match() was introduced in PHP 8. It is not valid with older PHP versions.
