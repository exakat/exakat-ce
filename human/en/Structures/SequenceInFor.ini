name = "Sequences In For";
description = "For() instructions allows several instructions in each of its parameters. Then, the instruction separator is comma ',', not semi-colon, which is used for separating the 3 arguments.

<?php
   for ($a = 0, $b = 0; $a < 10, $b < 20; $a++, $b += 3) {
    // For loop
   }
?>

This loop will simultaneously increment $a and $b. It will stop only when the last of the central sequence reach a value of false : here, when $b reach 20 and $a will be 6. 

This structure is often unknown, and makes the for instruction quite difficult to read. It is also easy to oversee the multiples instructions, and omit one of them.
It is recommended not to use it.
