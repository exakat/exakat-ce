name = "Sequences In For";
description = "For() instructions allow several instructions in each of its parameters. Then, the instruction separator is comma ',', not semi-colon, which is used for separating the 3 arguments.

<?php
   for ($a = 0, $b = 0; $a < 10, $b < 20; $a++, $b += 3) {
    // For loop
   }
?>

This loop will simultaneously increment `$a` and `$b`. It will stop only when the last of the central sequence reach a value of false : here, when `$b` reach 20 and `$a` will be 6. 

This structure is rarely used, and makes the `for()` instruction quite difficult to read. It is also easy to oversee the multiples instructions, and omit one of them.

It is recommended not to use it.
