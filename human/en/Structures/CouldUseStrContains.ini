description = "PHP 8 introduced the strcontains() function, which is a replacement for strpos(). strcontains() checks if a string is found inside a string, and returns a boolean. 

When strpos() is used as a boolean, or compared to a boolean, strcontains() is a good replacement. When strpos() is actually used to calculate a position inside a string, it should not be replaced.

strcontains() is not backward compatible, so it should be be used before PHP 8.0. Polyfills are available.";
