name = "Negative Power";
description = "The power operator ** has higher precedence than the sign operators + and -.

This means that -2 ** 2 == -4. It is in fact, -(2 ** 2). 

When using negative power, it is clearer to add parenthesis or to use the pow() function, which has no such ambiguity : 

<?php

// -2 to the power of 2 (a square)
pow(-2, 2) == 4;

// minus 2 to the power of 2 (a negative square)
-2 ** 2 == -(2 ** 2) == 4;
