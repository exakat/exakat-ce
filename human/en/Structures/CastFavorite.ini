name = "Favorite Casting Method";
description = "There are two methods for casting : the cast operators, or the conversion functions. The cast operators are ``int``, ``float`` and ``string``. The conversion functions are ``intval()``, ``floatval()`` and ``strval()``.

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that casting operators or conversion functions are used depending on coding style and files.

<?php

// be consistent
$a = (int) $_GET['a'];
$b = (float) $_GET['b'];
$c = (int) $_GET['c'];
$d = (int) $_GET['d'];
$e = (string) $_GET['e'];
$f = (int) $_GET['f'];
$g = (int) $_GET['g'];
$i = (int) $_GET['i'];
$j = (int) $_GET['j'];
$k = (int) $_GET['k'];
$l = intval($_GET['l']);
