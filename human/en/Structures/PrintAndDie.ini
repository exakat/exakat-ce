description = "Die() also prints. 

When stopping a script with die(), it is possible to provide a message as first argument, that will be displayed at execution. There is no need to make a specific call to print or echo.

<?php

//  die may do both print and die.
echo 'Error message';
die();

//  exit may do both print and die.
print 'Error message';
exit;

//  exit cannot print integers only : they will be used as status report to the system.
print 'Error message';
exit 1;
