name = "Inconsistent Concatenation";
description = "Concatenations happens within a string or using the dot operator. Using both is an inconsistent way of writing concatenations.

Switching methods of concatenation, sometimes in the same expression, is error prone. The reader gets confused, and may miss important information. 

<?php

    //Concatenation
  $consistent = $a . 'b'. $c;

    //Interpolation
  $consistentToo = \"{$a}b$c\";

    // Concatenation and interpolation
  $inconsistent = $a . \"b$c\";

    // Concatenation and interpolation too
  $consistentThree = <<<CONSISTENT
{$a}b$c
CONSISTENT;

    // Concatenation and interpolation collisions
  $collision = theClass::CONSTANTE . \"b{$c}\".number_format($t, 2).' $CAD'."\n";

?>

There are some situations where using concatenation are compulsory : when calling a constant, or a function, or make use of the escape sequence. Those are ignored in this analysis.
