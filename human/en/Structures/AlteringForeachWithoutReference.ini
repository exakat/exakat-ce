description = "Foreach() loop that could use a reference as value. 

When using a foreach loop that modifies the original source, it is recommended to use referenced variables, rather than access the original value with $source[$index]. 

Using references is then must faster, and easier to read. 



array_walk() and array_map() are also alternative to prevent the use of foreach(), when $key is not used.";

    // Here, $key MUST be the second argument or newValue

// Slow version to update the array
foreach($source as $key => &$value) {
    $source[$key] = newValue($value, $key);
