name = "Misused Yield";
description = "When chaining generator, one must use the yield from keyword.

Forgetting the yield from keyword cancels the generator nature of the functioncall and nothing is emited. 

Using ``yield`` on a generator, yields ... the generator, not the values of the generator.

<?php

function foo() {
	yield 1;
	// Goo is called, but not run as a generator
	goo();
}

function hoo() {
	yield 1;
	// Goo is yield, but not run as a generator
	yield goo();
}

function goo() {
	yield 3;
}

?>

It is legit to yield a generator, for later usage. This is just very uncommon, and worth a check.
