description = "When chaining generator, one must use the ``yield from`` keyword.

Forgetting the yield from keyword cancels the generator nature of the functioncall and nothing is emited. 

Using ``yield`` on a generator, yields ... the generator, not the values of the generator.

It is legit to yield a generator, for later usage. This is just very uncommon, and worth a check.";
