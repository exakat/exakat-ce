name = "No Hardcoded Path";
description = "It is not recommended to use hardcoded literals when designating files. Full paths are usually tied to one file system organization. As soon as the organisation changes or must be adapted to any external constraint, the path is not valid anymore.

Either use __FILE__ and __DIR__ to make the path relative to the current file; use a ``DOC_ROOT`` as a configuration constant that will allow the moving of the script to another folder; finally functions like sys_get_temp_dir() produce a viable temporary folder.

Relative paths are relative to the current execution directory, and not the current file. This means they may differ depending on the location of the start of the application, and are sensitive to chdir() and chroot() usage.

<?php

    // This depends on the current executed script
    file_get_contents('token.txt');

    // Exotic protocols are ignored
    file_get_contents('jackalope://file.txt');

    // Some protocols are ignored : http, https, ftp, ssh2, php (with memory)
    file_get_contents('http://www.php.net/');
    file_get_contents('php://memory/');
    
    // glob() with special chars * and ? are not reported
    glob('./*/foo/bar?.txt');
    // glob() without special chars * and ? are reported
    glob('/foo/bar/');
