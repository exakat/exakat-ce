name = "Is Actually Zero";
description = "This addition actually may be simplified because one term is actually negated by another. 

This kind of error happens when the expression is very large : the more terms are included, the more chances are that some auto-annihilation happens. 

This error may also be a simple typo : for example, calculating the difference between two consecutive terms.

<?php

// This is quite obvious
$a = 2 - 2;

// This is obvious too. This may be a typo-ed difference between two consecutive terms. 
// Could have been $c = $fx[3][4] - $fx[3][3] or $c = $fx[3][5] - $fx[3][4];
$c = $fx[3][4] - $fx[3][4];

// This is less obvious
$a = $b[3] - $c + $d->foo(1,2,3) + $c + $b[3];

?>
