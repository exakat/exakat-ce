name = "Die Exit Consistence";
description = "Die and Exit have the same functional use. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that die or exit are used depending on coding style and files. One file may be consistently using exit, while the others are all using exit. 

<?php

// be consistent
switch ($a) {
    case 1 : 
        exit;
    case 2 : 
        exit;
    case 3 : 
        exit;
    case 4 : 
        exit;
    case 5 : 
        exit;
    case 6 : 
        exit;
    case 7 : 
        exit;
    case 8 : 
        exit;
    case 9 : 
        exit;
    case 10 : 
        exit;
    default : 
        die();   // Be consistent, always use the same. 
}

?>

Using die or exit is also the target of other analysis.
