description = "Foreach loops have the ability to use list() (or []) as blind variables. This syntax assign directly array elements to various variables. 

PHP 5.5 introduced the usage of list in foreach() loops. Until PHP 7.1, it was not possible to use non-numerical arrays as list() wouldn't support string-indexed arrays.
Previously, it was compulsory to extract() the data from the blind array :";
