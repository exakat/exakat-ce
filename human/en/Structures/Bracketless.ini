name = "Bracketless Blocks";
description = "PHP allows one liners as for(), foreach(), while(), do/while() loops, or as then/else expressions. 

It is generally considered a bad practice, as readability is lower and there are non-negligible risk of excluding from the loop the next instruction.

<?php

// Legit one liner
foreach(range('a', 'z') as $letter) ++$letterCount;

// More readable version, even for a one liner.
foreach(range('a', 'z') as $letter) {
    ++$letterCount;
}

?>

switch() cannot be without bracket.
