description = "Nested conditions may be written another way, and reduce the amount of code.

Nested conditions are equivalent to a ``&&`` condition. As such, they may be switched. When one of the condition has no explicit else, then it is lighter to write it as the first condition. This way, it is written once, and not repeated.

<?php

// Less conditions are written here.
  	if($b == 2) {
        if($a == 1) {
    		++$c;
    	}
        else {
    		++$d;
    	}
    }

// ($b == 2) is double here
    if($a == 1) {
    	if($b == 2) {
    		++$c;
    	}
    }
    else {
    	if($b == 2) {
