description = "New lines may be written with the sequence \n or with the constant PHP_EOL.

When one of those alternatives is used over 90% of the time, it is considered as standard : the remaining are reported.

\n are only located when used alone, in "\n" (including the double quotes). When \n is used inside a double-quoted string, its replacement with PHP_EOL would be cumbersome : as such, they are ignored by this analyzer.

<?php

// This may be repeated over 10 times
$a = "PHP is a great language\n";
$a .= "\n";

// This only appears once in the code : this line is reported.
$b = $a.PHP_EOL.$c;
