name = "Concatenation Interpolation Consistence";
description = "Concatenations are done with the . operator or by interpolation inside a string. 

Interpolation is a clean way to write concatenation, though it gets messy with long dereferences or with constants. Concatenations are longer to write. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

<?php

// be consistent
$a = "$b $c";
$d = "$b $e";
$e = "$b $e";
$d = "$b $f";
$f = "$b $z";
$h = "$b $e";
$y = "$b $e";
$d = "$b $x";
$j = "$b $c";
$d = "$b $g";
$d = "$b $h";

// Be consistent, always use the same. 
$z = $w.' '.$e;
