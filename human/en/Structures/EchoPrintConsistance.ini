There seems to be a choice that is not enforced : one form is dominant, (> 90%) while the others are rare. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of the three : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that print, echo or <?= are used depending on coding style and files. One file may be consistently using print, while the others are all using echo.";
