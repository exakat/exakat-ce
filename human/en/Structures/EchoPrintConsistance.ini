name = "Echo Or Print";
description = "Echo and print have the same functional use. <?= and printf() are also considered in this analysis. 

There seems to be a choice that is not enforced : one form is dominant, (> 90%) while the others are rare. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of the three : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

It happens that print, echo or <?= are used depending on coding style and files. One file may be consistently using print, while the others are all using echo. 

<?php

echo 'a';
echo 'b';
echo 'c';
echo 'd';
echo 'e';
echo 'f';
echo 'g';
echo 'h';
echo 'i';
echo 'j';
echo 'k';

// This should probably be written 'echo';
print 'l';

?>
