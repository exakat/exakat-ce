name = "Could Be Ternary";
description = "This control structure may be replaced by a ternary operator. 

Th ternary operator may be shorter and easier to read than the full blown if-then-else structure. 

<?php

// original structure
if (empty($a)) {
    $b = 1;
} else {
    $b = foo();
}

// ternary version : 
$b = empty($a) ? 1 : foo();

?>

Depending on the situation, the null-ternary and the coalesce operator may also be a good alternative.
