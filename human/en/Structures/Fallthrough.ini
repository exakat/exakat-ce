name = "Switch Fallthrough";
description = "A switch with fallthrough is prone to errors. 

A fallthrough happens when a case or default clause in a switch statement is not finished by a break (or equivalent);
CWE report this as a security concern, unless well documented.

A fallthrough may be used as a feature. Then, it is indistinguishable from an error. 

When the case block is empty, this analysis doesn't report it : the case is then used as an alias.

<?php
switch($variable) {
    case 1 :   // case 1 is not reported, as it actually shares the same body as case 33
    case 33 :  
        break ;
    case 2 : 
        break ;
    default: 
        ++$a;
    case 4 : 
        break ;
}
?>

This analysis doesn't take into account comments about the fallthrough.
