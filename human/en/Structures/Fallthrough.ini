name = "Switch Fallthrough";
description = "A switch with fallthrough is prone to errors. 

A fallthrough happens when a case or default clause in a switch statement is not finished by a break (or equivalent);
CWE report this as a security concern, unless well documented.

A fallthrough may be used as a feature. Then, it is indistinguishable from an error. 

When the case block is empty, this analysis doesn't report it : the case is then used as an alias.
This analysis doesn't take into account comments about the fallthrough.";
