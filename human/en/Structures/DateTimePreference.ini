In the date() team, there are the following functions : date(), time(), getdate(), localtime(), strtotime(), strptime(), gmdate(), strftime(), mktime(), gmktime().

In the DateTime team, there are the instantiation of DateTime and DateTimeImmutable; the DateTime::createFromInterface(), DateTime::createFromFormat(), DateTime::createFromImmutable() and DateTime::createFromMutable().
