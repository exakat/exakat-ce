name = "date() versus DateTime Preference";
description = "Processing dates is done with date() functions or DateTime classes. 

In the date() team, there are the following functions : date(), time(), getdate(), localtime(), strtotime(), strptime(), gmdate(), strftime(), mktime(), gmktime().

In the DateTime team, there are the instantiation of DateTime and DateTimeImmutable; the DateTime::createFromInterface(), DateTime::createFromFormat(), DateTime::createFromImmutable() and DateTime::createFromMutable(). 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

<?php

// be consistent
$date = date();
$time = time();
$date = date();
$time = time();
$date = date();
$time = time();
$date = date();
$time = time();
$date = date();
$time = time();
$date = date();
$time = time();

// Be consistent, always use the same. 
$date = new DateTime();
