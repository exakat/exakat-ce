name = "No Append On Source";
description = "Do not append new elements to an array in a foreach loop. Since PHP 7.0, the array is still used as a source, and will be augmented, and used again. 

<?php

// Relying on the initial copy
$a = [1];
$initial = $a;
foreach($initial as $v) {
    $a[] = $v + 1;
}

// Keep new results aside
$a = [1];
$tmp = [];
foreach($a as $v) {
    $tmp[] = $v + 1;
}
$a = array_merge($a, $tmp);
unset($tmp);

// Example, courtesy of Frederic Bouchery
// This is an infinite loop
$a = [1];
foreach($a as $v) {
    $a[] = $v + 1;
}

?>
