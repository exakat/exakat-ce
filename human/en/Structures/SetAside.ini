name = "Set Aside Code";
description = "Setting aside code should be made into a method. 

Setting aside code happens when one variable or member is stored locally, to be temporarily replaced by another value. Once the new value has been processed, the original value is reverted.

The temporary change of the value makes the code hard to read. 

It is a good example of a piece of code that could be moved to a separate method or function. Using the temporary value as a parameter makes the change visible, and avoid local pollution.";
