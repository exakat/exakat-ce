name = "Const Or Define";
description = "``const`` and ``define()`` have the same functional use : create constants. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of them : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

They are almost interchangeable, though not totally : ``define()`` allows the creation of case-insensitive constants, while ``Const`` won\'t.
