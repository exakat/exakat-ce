name = "Yoda Comparison";
description = "Yoda comparison is a way to write conditions which places literal values on the left side. 

<?php
  if (1 == $a) {
    // Then condition
  } 
?>

The objective is to avoid mistaking a comparison to an assignation. If the comparison operator is mistaken, but the literal is on the left, then an error will be triggered, instead of a silent bug. 

<?php
    // error in comparison! 
    if ($a = 1) {
        // Then condition
    } 
?>
