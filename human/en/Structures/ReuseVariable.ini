name = "Reuse Existing Variable";
description = "A variable is already holding the content that is calculated again : it should be used again. 

It is recommended to use the cached value. This saves some computation, in particular when used in a loop, and speeds up the process. This is called memoization.

<?php

function foo($a) {
    $b = strtolower($a);
    
    // strtolower($a) is already calculated in $b. Just reuse the value.
    if (strtolower($a) === 'c') {
        doSomething();
    }
}

?>

Some expressions are not idempotent, and should not be cached. For example, calls to time() or fgets() may return different values with the same parameters.

This may be a micro-optimisation.
