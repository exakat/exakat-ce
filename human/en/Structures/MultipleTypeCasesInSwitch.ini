name = "Multiple Type Cases In Switch";
description = "This reports switch() instructions, which have several types in cases.

This might generate compatibility errors, as the comparison may succeed in different ways, depending on PHP versions. This is particularly the case for PHP 8.0, and values such as '0', '', 0, null, and false.

<?php

switch($a) {
	case 1: 
		break;
		
	case 'a':
		break;
}

?>

This situation doesn't affect match(), as it uses a strict type comparison, unlike switch().
