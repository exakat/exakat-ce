name = "Concat Empty String";
description = "Using a concatenation to make a value a string should be replaced with a type cast.

Type cast to a string is done with ``(string)`` operator. There is also the function strval(), although it is less recommended.

<?php

$a = 3;

// explicite way to cast a value
$b = (string) $a; // $b is a string with the content 3

// Wrong way to cast a value
$c = $a . ''; // $c is a string with the content 3
$c = '' . $a; // $c is a string with the content 3
$a .= '';     // $a is a string with the content 3

// Wrong way to cast a value
$c = $a . '' . $b; // This is not reported. The empty string is useless, but not meant to type cast

?>
