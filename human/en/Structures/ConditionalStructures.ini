name = "Conditional Structures";
description = "Structures that are defined, but only executed conditionally.

It is possible to create conditioned functions, classes, interfaces, traits and enumerations. Constants have to be defined with define() and can't use the `const` keyword.

Classes elements, such as methods, can't be conditional.
