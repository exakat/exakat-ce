description = "The loop is operating on a block that is too long. 

This analysis is applied to loops (for, foreach, while, do..while) and if/then/else/elseif structures.

Then length of a block is managed with the ``longBlock`` parameter. By default, it is 200 lines, from beginning to the end. Comments are taken into account.

<?php

$i = 0;
do {
    // 200 lines of PHP code
    
    ++$i;
