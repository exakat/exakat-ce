name = "One Expression Brackets Consistency";
description = "Brackets around one-line expressions are not consistent. 

PHP makes bracket optional when a control structure pilot only one expression. Both are semantically identical.

This analysis reports code that uses brackets while the vast majority of other expressions uses none. Or the contrary. 

<?php

// One expression with brackets
for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { $c++; }

// One expression without bracket
for($i2 = 0; $i2 < 10; $i2++)  $c++; 

?>

Another analysis, [Structures/Bracketless], reports the absence of brackets as an error.
