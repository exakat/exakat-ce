name = "Unsupported Operand Types";
description = "This error is raised when trying to combine an array and a scalar value. 

Always checks that the types are compatible with the planned operations.

<?php

const MY_ARRAY = 'error';

// This leads to the infamous "Unsupported operand types" error
$b = MY_ARRAY + array(3,4);

?>

PHP detects this error at linting time, when using literal values. When static expression are involved, this error will appear at execution time.
