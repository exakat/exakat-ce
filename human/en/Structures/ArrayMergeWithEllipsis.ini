name = "array_merge With Ellipsis";
description = "Ellipsis, or ..., returns a null when the operand array is empty. This doesn't suit array_merge(). 

It is recommended to use a coalesce operator, to handle graciously an empty array : use an empty array as default value.

This applies to the following PHP functions : 

* array_merge()
* array_merge_recursive()
* array_diff()
* array_diff_assoc()
* array_diff_key()
* array_diff_uassoc()";

// Notee the nested array
$a = [ ];
$b = array_merge(...$a ?: [[]] );

// Yield an error because $a is empty
$a = [ ];
$b = array_merge(...$a);
