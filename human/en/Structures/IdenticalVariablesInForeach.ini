name = "Identical Variables In Foreach";
description = "Do not use the same name for foreach() source and one of its blind variable. 

Foreach() makes a copy of the original data while working on it : this prevents any interference. Yet, when the source and the blind variable is the same, the source will have changed after the loop. 

<?php

// classic way to use a foreach loop
foreach($array as $key => $value) {
    // doSomething with $key and $value
}

// unusual way to end up with a name conflict
foreach($a as $a => [$b, $c, $a]) {
    // doSomething with $a and $a, $b, $c
}


// classic way to use a foreach loop
foreach($a as $a => $b) {
    // doSomething with $a and $a
}
// Now, after the loop, $a is an integer or a string!
