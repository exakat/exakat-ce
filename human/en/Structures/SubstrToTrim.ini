name = "Substr To Trim";
description = "When removing the first or the last character of a string, trim() does a more readable job. 

trim(), ltrim() and rtrim() accept a string as second argument. Those will all be removed from the endings of the string.
trim() will remove all occurrences of the requested char(). This may remove a loop with substr(), or remove more than is needed. 

trim() doesn't work with multi-bytes strings, but so does substr(). For that, use mb_substr(), as there isn't any mb_trim() function (so far in PHP 8.2).";

$a = '$drop the dollar';

$b = ltrim($a, '$'); // remove the initial '$'s


$b = substr($a, 1);     // replace with ltrim()

$b = substr($a, 0, -1); // replace with rtrim()

$b = substr($a, 1, -1); // replace with trim()
