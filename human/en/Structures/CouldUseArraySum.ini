name = "Could Use array_sum()";
description = "These loops could use array_sum(). array_sum() loops over the array and sum all of its elements. It is a native PHP function, faster to execute and easier to read.

<?php

$total = 0;
foreach($array as $b) {
    $total = $total + $b;
}

?>

When the added elements are, in fact, arrays, use array_merge() instead of array_sum().

This is a micro-optimisation : it will speed up the code, but won't bring large improvements.
