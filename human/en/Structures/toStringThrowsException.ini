name = "__toString() Throws Exception";
description = "Magical method __toString() can't throw exceptions.

In fact, __toString() may not let an exception pass. If it throw an exception, but must catch it. If an underlying method throws an exception, it must be caught.

<?php

class myString {
    private $string = null;
    
    public function __construct($string) {
        $this->string = $string;
    }
    
    public function __toString() {
        // Do not throw exceptions in __toString
        if (!is_string($this->string)) {
            throw new Exception(\"$this->string is not a string!!\");
        }
        
        return $this->string;
    }
}   

?>

A fatal error is displayed, when an exception is not intercepted in the __toString() function.
