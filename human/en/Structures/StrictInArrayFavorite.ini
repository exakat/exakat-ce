description = "It is possible to set in_array() to strict search mode, by using the third argument.

The analyzed code has less than 10% of one of the two sets : for consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

Warning : the two sets of operators have different precedence levels. Using and or && is not exactly the same, especially and not only, when assigning the results to a variable. 

<?php 

// relax mode : value may use typejuggling with the array values
in_array($value, $array );

// strict mode : value is compared to array's value with both data and type
in_array($value, $array, true);

?>

In doubt, it is recommended to use the strict mode.
