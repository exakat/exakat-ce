name = "Declare Static Once";
description = "Global and static variables should be declared only once in a method. It is also recommended to configure it at the beginning of the method. This could be refined by defining the variable at the last common moment, though it lacks readability.

<?php

function foo() {
    if (rand(0, 1)) {
        static $x;
        
        ++$x;
    } else {
        static $x;
        
        --$x;
    }
}

?>

Defining static or global methods late is a micro-optimisation.
