name = "Static Global Variables Confusion";
description = "PHP can't have variable that are both static and global variable. While the syntax is legit, the variables will be alternatively global or static.

It is recommended to avoid using the same name for a global variable and a static variable. 

<?php

function foo() {
    $a = 1; // $a is a local variable
    
    global $a; // $a is now a global variable
    
    static $a; // $a is not w static variable 
}

?>
