Structures that commonly accept several lines, like match(), switch(), classes, functions, closures, constant definitions, etc. are omitted. 

Multiline expressions, like complex expressions, tend to be less readable. Although, some multiline expressions are written to make them more readable, compared to a one-line complex expression.
