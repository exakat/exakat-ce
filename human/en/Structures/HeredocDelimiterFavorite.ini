name = "Heredoc Delimiter";
description = "Heredoc and Nowdoc expressions may use a variety of delimiters. 

There seems to be a standard delimiter in the code, and some exceptions : one or several forms are dominant (> 90%), while the others are rare. 

The analyzed code has less than 10% of the rare delimiters. For consistency reasons, it is recommended to make them all the same. 

Generally, one or two delimiters are used, with generic value. It is recommended to use a humanly readable delimiter : SQL, HTML, XML, GREMLIN, etc. This helps readability in the code.";
