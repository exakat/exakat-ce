name = "Implicit Conversion To Int";
description = "PHP warns when a value is implicitely converted from float to int. This usually leads to a loss of precision and unexpected values.

The conversion happens in various situations in PHP lifecycle (extracted from the wiki article): 

+ Bitwise OR operator |
+ Bitwise AND operator &
+ Bitwise XOR operator ^
+ Shift right and left operators
+ Modulo operator
+ The combined assignment operators of the above operators
+ Assignment to a typed property of type int in coercive typing mode
+ Argument for a parameter of type int for both internal and userland functions in coercive typing mode
+ Returning such a value for userland functions declared with a return type of int in coercive typing mode
+ Bitwise NOT operator ~
+ As an array key

<?php

function foo(int $i) {}

//Implicit conversion from float 1.2 to int loses precision
foo(1.2);

?>

This features is applied to PHP 8.1 and later, yet it is also applicable to older versions of PHP.
