description = "There is no need to check the size of an array content before using foreach. Foreach() applies a test on the source, and skips the loop if no element is found.

<?php

// Checking for type is good. 
if (is_array($array)) {
    foreach($array as $a) {
        doSomething($a);

// Foreach on empty arrays doesn't start. Checking is useless

This analysis checks for conditions with sizeof() and count(). Conditions with isset() and empty() are omitted : they also check for the variable existence, and thus, offer extra coverage.
