name = "Dereferencing String And Arrays";
description = "PHP allows the direct dereferencing of strings and arrays. 

This was added in PHP 5.5. There is no need anymore for an intermediate variable between a string and array (or any expression generating such value) and accessing an index.

<?php
$x = array(4,5,6); 
$y = $x[2] ; // is 6

May be replaced by 
$y = array(4,5,6)[2];
$y = [4,5,6][2];
?>
