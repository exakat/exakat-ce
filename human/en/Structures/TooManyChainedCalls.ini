name = "Too Many Chained Calls";
description = "Report chained calls of functions, methods and static methods are crammed in one expression.

This makes the whole expression difficult to read, and it is possible to miss some important parameter or intermidate calls when reviewing it. 

This may lead to bugs when some of the intermediate calls may return an invalid result, such as `null` or `false` in case of error. Those must be tested before being propagated.
