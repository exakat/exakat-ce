description = "htmlspecialchars(), htmlentities(), htmlspecialchars_decode(), html_entity_decode() and get_html_translation_table(), are used to prevent injecting special characters in HTML code. As a bare minimum, they take a string and encode it for HTML.

The second argument of the functions is the type of protection. The protection may apply to quotes or not, to HTML 4 or 5, etc. It is highly recommended to set it explicitly.

In PHP 8.1, the default value of this parameter has changed. It used to be ``ENT_COMPAT`` and is now ``ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE``. The main difference between the different configuration is that the single quote, which was left intact so far, is now protected HTML style.";
