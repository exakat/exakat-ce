description = "Function can't return literals by reference.

When a function returns a reference, it is only possible to return variables, properties or static properties. 

Anything else, like literals or static expressions, yield a warning at execution time.

<?php

// Can't return a literal number
function &foo() {
    return 3 + rand();
}

// bar must return values that are stored in a 
function &bar() {
    $a = 3 + rand();
    return $a;
}
